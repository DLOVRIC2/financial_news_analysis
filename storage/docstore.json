beat, and yet the stock trades modestly lower. That response makes sense if you dig into the quarter a bit. </p><ul><li>In terms of revenue, MSFT did quite well overall, reporting upside relative to prior guidance in two of its three segments - Intelligent Cloud (IC) and More Personal Computing (MPC) - while Productivity and Business Processes' (PBP) result was in-line.<ul><li> A slight negative is that growth rates declined from MarQ in PBP (15% to 6%) and IC (27% to 17%). Offsetting that was MPC (+3% to +14%), which saw an acceleration as Windows OEM, Surface, and Gaming benefitted from more people at home. </li></ul></li><li>In terms of EPS, MSFT broke its string of double digit EPS beats at five in a row. The $0.08 upside this quarter was good, but it was not quite as robust as the beats delivered in recent quarters. </li><li>Probably more troubling was a modest degradation in growth in several key areas: <ul><li>Most prominently, in MSFT's Azure cloud computing business, its crown jewel, growth slowed a bit to 47% in JunQ from 59% in MarQ. </li><li>Office Commercial products and cloud services slowed to +5% from +13% in MarQ. </li><li>IC Server products and cloud services slowed to +19% in JunQ from +30% in MarQ. </li><li>LinkedIn growth slowed to +10% in JunQ from +21% in MarQ, as it was impacted by a weak job market and reductions in advertising spend. </li><li>Search was negatively impacted by reductions in advertising spend. </li><li>Transactional license purchasing continued to slow, particularly in small and medium businesses. </li></ul></li></ul><p>Overall, this was still a very good quarter, with a solid beat on revenue and EPS. The primary culprits for the stock's move lower, we think, is lackluster PBP segment growth coupled with Azure's performance. While Azure had great growth, with so many companies and consumers using the cloud as they work/learn from home, the Azure number was a slight letdown. This may be a slight cause for concern for Amazon (AMZN) and its rival AWS unit, which reports on July 30.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "a4dcb096-eea1-4baf-9993-e2cec9b43d69", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "53df799d91ee269fa8fe6bf9209c12a1b6aeefc2bda49db2c55051671d9f94b2", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2297, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "faad5357-8c18-4fd0-aba4-a10cb168e1f5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3dae6ad7-a729-4309-a817-69c48d1ffffc": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p><strong>Apple (AAPL +7%)</strong> is tasting good to investors today as the stock breaks above $400 for the first time ever. Not only was it a strong upside <a bhref=\"https://www.briefing.com/InPlayEq/NewsFeed/newsdoc?id=646155\" target=\"_blank\">quarter</a> for Q3 (Jun), but Apple threw in a 4-for-1 stock split for good measure. </p><ul><li>EPS and revenue both came in well ahead of analyst expectations. <ul><li> The $0.51 EPS upside was Apple's largest by far in the past five years. </li><li> The company has now posted four consecutive $0.20+ EPS beats, which is unusual as Apple typically beats in the mid-single digits to low teens. </li></ul></li><li> Apple performed well across its bevy of offerings. <ul><li> iPhone revenues +1.5% yr/yr to $26.4 bln vs $22.0 bln estimates; </li><li> Services revenues +14.8% yr/yr to $13.2 bln vs $13 bln ests; </li><li> iPad +22% yr/yr to $7.08 bln; </li><li> Mac revs +31% yr/yr to $6.6 bln; </li><li>Wearables +16% yr/yr to $6.6 bln. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Apple is benefitting from the shift to at-home work/school</strong>, which has pushed people to buy new products, apps and services. The economic stimulus measures and the lifting of stay-at-home restrictions were tailwinds in May and June. </li><li><strong>What really helped the iPhone numbers was strong sales of the SE phone</strong> which launched in April 2020. <ul><li>Its $399 starting price point makes it competitive in emerging markets and attractive for people who do not need all the bells and whistles of the high-end iPhones. </li></ul></li><li> <strong>Apple pushed back the availability of its new iPhones \"a few weeks later\"</strong> than its usual September timeline due to supply chain issues stemming from plant closures and travel restrictions.  <ul><li>However, this was likely not a big surprise. Dan Niles was on CNBC last week saying there would likely be a month push-out. </li></ul></li><li>Another slight negative was Apple again not providing guidance for the upcoming quarter, as the manufacturing/COVID-19 issues make it difficult to predict when the new iPhones will come out. <ul><li>With that said, investors are pretty excited about this upcoming launch. For most years, the new iPhones have just had incremental improvements, like better chips or better cameras. This year will be a big step up as Apple will finally debut its long-awaited 5G iPhone. Even without guidance, it's safe to assume there will be huge demand for the 5G phones. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Finally, the stock split as a nice cherry on top.</strong> We know it should not matter what the stock price is, but it does matter for a lot of investors and makes it easier for small investors to buy in. </li></ul><p><strong>Overall, this was a fantastic quarter for Apple</strong> with a huge beat and what's notable is that there was not a significant weak spot among any product category. Often, a category or two do not carry their weight, but JunQ was uniformly good. Some guidance would have been nice and the iPhone delay by a few weeks is slightly disappointing, but these items were pretty much expected. Looking ahead, the 5G iPhone should be a big tailwind although more for DecQ probably and not for SepQ.  </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "3dae6ad7-a729-4309-a817-69c48d1ffffc", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c91fce4f01aa4537d2e9f22040ca6ef4285ba90058ec9d2066c1cb55a6e9f97f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3306, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ace6cf68-4fc6-4e27-abd2-66cb1b46483d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7dfd5f84-10ed-44a5-9bc4-692eb195ea2d": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p>The headline Q2 numbers for <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) look solid on the surface after the tech giant topped analysts' EPS and revenue expectations. The company generated EPS of $10.13, comfortably exceeding the $8.23 consensus estimate, on revenue of $38.3 bln compared to the $37.3 bln expectation.<br><br> Those expectations, though, forecasted EPS to plummet by 42% yr/yr. While GOOG managed to handily beat that bleak projection, EPS still fell by 29% and revenue dipped lower by 2%, marking the first ever yr/yr top-line drop for GOOG.<br><br> During GOOG's Q1 earnings conference call on April 28, CFO Ruth Porat commented that Q2 will be difficult due to the drop-off in advertising spending. That prediction came to fruition as advertising revenue fell by 8% to $29.87 bln.<br><br> The pandemic wreaked havoc on the economy in Q2, as illustrated by the 32.9% nose-dive in GDP for the quarter. When the economy struggles, advertising spending is typically one of the first areas that companies pull back on, as illustrated by the decline in GOOG's ad revenue.<br><br> GOOG had a more difficult time retaining advertising spending than <strong>Facebook </strong>(<strong>FB</strong>), which reported a 10% increase in advertising revenue for Q2. The weaker performance for GOOG could be due to its heavy reliance on smaller and medium-sized businesses, some of which may not have the resources to withstand the economic fallout from the pandemic.<br><br> On the positive side, CEO Sundar Pichai stated that the company saw early signs of stabilization across most verticals as users returned to commercial activity. Consequently, yr/yr search revenue trends improved during the quarter with search revenues essentially flat by the end of June.<br><br> Despite the improvement, Pichai remained cautious, adding that the global economic environment is fragile. <br><br> While GOOG's ad business struggles to regain momentum, there are other notable pockets of strength throughout the company.</p><ul><li>For instance, Google Cloud revenue jumped by 43% to $3.0 bln. Encouragingly, GOOG said it is gaining traction with larger customers who are signing multi-year contracts with the company. This is evidenced by its substantial backlog, which amounted to $14.8 bln at the end of the quarter.</li><li>YouTube and Google Play were two other areas of strength. Advertising revenue on YouTube climbed by 6% to $3.8 bln and the Google Play app experienced a 35% yr/yr increase in game downloads. The solid performance in both of these businesses can mainly be tied to people staying at home who are looking for information and entertainment options.</li></ul><p>The stronger results from GOOG's other businesses (Cloud, YouTube, Play) helped the company outperform Q2 expectations. The bar for GOOG to hurdle was set very low, taking some of the luster off the company's upside results. The main question moving forward is whether the positive trends seen in GOOG's core ad business will continue into 2H20. The answer to that question rests on the global economy, which remains shaky and uncertain.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "7dfd5f84-10ed-44a5-9bc4-692eb195ea2d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "196dbbc89ed1b8b011d21b2226b8c2ab0718beb82b43ffd4d629fb7050bda075", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3194, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "b2c5b898-5752-4043-9126-ecb5ab6c8203"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "96c2bff0-340c-4abb-9e05-30d7eb2bbdbe": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT +4%)</strong> announced over the weekend in a blog post that, following a conversation between CEO Satya Nadella and President Trump, Microsoft will continue discussions to explore a purchase of TikTok, a video sharing app that has become very popular, especially among younger people in the US. </p><p>  There have been concerns that the app, which is owned by China-based ByteDance, could be collecting data on US citizens and that the app could possibly be used to spread Chinese propaganda. Microsoft says that it fully appreciates these concerns and, if a deal can be reached on price, that it would subject TikTok to a complete security review.  </p><p><strong>Why would Microsoft want to buy TikTok? </strong>Microsoft has been mostly focused on enterprise corporate clients. While it has exposure on the consumer side with its very popular Xbox, Minecraft, and Surface businesses, MSFT does not have much exposure on the social media front. TikTok would serve as a prize property in that regard given its huge popularity.  </p><p>A problem we have is that we do not know for certain what TikTok's financials look like. However, according to app-tracking firm SensorTower.com, revenue in 2019 jumped to nearly $177 mln, more than 5x its 2018 levels. TikTok also saw more than 738 mln downloads in 2019. We do not have data in terms of profits, and the company may be unprofitable. However, given MSFT's large size, TikTok's potential losses are unlikely to have a big impact on MSFT's overall results.</p><p>  <strong>TikTok sort of reminds us of YouTube in its early days,</strong> and look at what that has grown into, with YouTubeTV now competing with cable as a streaming TV viewership service. We could see the same thing happening with TikTok down the road. Also, because TikTok's user base skews younger, TikTok would be very attractive to advertisers, who tend to prefer that demographic because its members are yet not as set in their ways in terms of brand loyalties relative to older consumers. </p><p> <strong>Overall, we think this would be a pretty bold move for MSFT</strong>, allowing it to buy a burgeoning name in the social media arena. We see TikTok as sort of a crown jewel in social media. And while MSFT is likely to pay a pretty penny, the price would only likely go up in the next few years as TikTok continues to grow. The movement in MSFT's stock price today shows investors like this deal.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "96c2bff0-340c-4abb-9e05-30d7eb2bbdbe", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "355753036c0d0dedbf01e0483a1256667706962b06068f9728da60b46a70c49f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2520, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "0e495e71-bfdf-4f99-b05a-07bb77ca188b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad2027db-7415-4d02-92ff-04c5c15c3604": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p>With shares hovering around all-time highs, <strong>NVIDIA</strong> (<strong>NVDA</strong>) is set to report Q2 results after the close today with a conference call to follow at 5:00 pm ET. The maker of graphic processing units (GPUs) has been on a roll, easily surpassing analysts' EPS and revenue expectations in each of the past three quarters.<br><br>The company's impressive performance has raised the bar heading into tonight's report. Given the stock's ~40% run since its Q1 report, and an accompanying 1-year forward P/E of ~62x, NVDA will need a very strong showing to keep the upward momentum going.&nbsp;<br><br>For the quarter, NVDA is expected to post EPS and revenue of $1.97 and $3.66 bln. On a yr/yr basis, an inline quarter pencils out to EPS and revenue growth of 59% and 41%, respectively. Not only will NVDA need to exceed these Q2 growth rates, but it will also need to issue Q3 revenue guidance above the current $3.97 bln consensus estimate.</p><p>NVDA, which is traditionally known for producing gaming system chips, has increasingly strengthened its presence in the datacenter realm. This strategy has paid major dividends for the company and represents a key catalyst behind its recent success.<br><br>Last quarter, data revenue surged by 80% to $1.14 bln, accounting for&nbsp;37% of total revenue. Within this segment, there are a couple primary factors driving NVDA's robust growth:</p><ul><li>In the past, GPUs weren't seen as an important component of data centers. However, as&nbsp;data centers become more complex and field massive amounts of information, GPUs have increasingly become part of the mix in the architecture.</li><li>An ever-increasing number of enterprises are moving data off-premise and onto the cloud. The pandemic has accelerated this trend as more work and data moves off site,&nbsp;creating the need to access data and networks from various locations.</li></ul><p>While NVDA's datacenter business excels, the company's core gaming unit has also generated solid results. In Q1, revenue climbed by 27% to $1.33 bln, as stay-at-home rules ignited a rise in gaming. In turn, demand for NVDA's gaming laptop chips accelerated.<br><br>As social distancing measures have eased since the end of Q1, NVDA's gaming unit may have experienced a slowdown. However, looking ahead, <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<strong>MSFT</strong>) and <strong>Sony</strong> (<strong>SNE</strong>) are expected to launch new gaming consoles later this year. Combined with ongoing strength in laptops, the gaming unit looks poised to deliver healthy growth over the next couple of quarters.<br><br>While the arrow is clearly pointing up heading into tonight's print, one risk that investors should be aware of is that higher-than-expected acquisition costs could ding NVDA's bottom line. On April 27, NVDA completed its $7 bln acquisition of Mellanox. Due to costs associated with the acquisition, the company expects&nbsp;GAAP gross margin to slip to 58.1%-61.1% compared to gross margin of 65.1% in Q1. </p><p>However, since these are non-recurring expenses, we wouldn't expect the reaction to be overly severe even if costs are more than the company projected. The much more prominent risk is that NVDA faces sky-high expectations and that anything other than a sizable beat will be viewed as a disappointment.<br><br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "ad2027db-7415-4d02-92ff-04c5c15c3604", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7cfb5c99868308f345d78770cd03d0a1d1ce0e0e211cf1498f49159f42c0b133", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3439, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "d2752689-6790-4940-bc8f-9a0a2a02987e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "82c78059-78e3-4f05-bd52-ca19e9c3b137": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p>Operating at the crossroads of two powerful trends, GPU maker<strong> NVIDIA </strong>(<strong>NVDA</strong>) has become a premier growth stock and a highly favored name within the semiconductor space. </p><ul><li>Thanks to an explosion in gaming activity during the pandemic, NVDA's gaming unit has experienced a surge in demand for its graphics chips. </li><li>At the same time, NVDA's burgeoning data center (DC) business is generating triple-digit growth as enterprises move an ever-expanding variety of content to the cloud.</li><li>This pair of catalysts, combined with its recent acquisition of Mellanox, has laid the foundation for NVDA's resurgence. </li></ul><p>Analysts have greatly underestimated the momentum underlying NVDA's business.

The tentative production plan for 2021 is nearly on par with the record 231.5 mln iPhones shipped in 2015. However, the article also noted that industrywide shortages of key components could threaten that target. Nevertheless, this was a bullish outlook.  </p><p><strong>So, what does this mean?</strong> </p><ul><li>Recall that Apple unfortunately did not provide specific Q1 (Dec) guidance when it reported Q4 (Sep) results in late October. Therefore, <strong>it's only through reporting like this that we have a sense of what to expect </strong>when Apple reports DecQ results in late January. It also bodes well for MarQ. </li><li>With Apple having rolled out its first 5G phone in November, <strong>we had already suspected that demand was robust, and this substantial increase in production goals only confirms our belief.</strong> In most years, Apple's new iPhone launches have included just incremental improvements, like better chips or better cameras. This year's model, though, was a big step up, as Apple finally launched its long-awaited 5G iPhone. These production numbers are great evidence that consumers were chomping at the bit. </li><li>Production numbers like this change the narrative. We have heard a lot in recent years about how iPhone unit sales were slowing after Apple posted two consecutive years of smartphone shipment declines in 2018 and 2019. Growth appears to be back on the horizon in 2020 and 2021.  </li><li>However, when Apple rolls out its next phone in Sep/Oct 2021, we think investors should brace for another decline because Apple will be lapping the surge from the 5G rollout. Our overall sense is that this talk of unit sale declines is generally not a big deal. Once a product like Apple's iPhone reaches such a massive scale, investors should not be expecting great growth numbers in perpetuity. </li><li><strong>The production boost is also great news for Apple suppliers. Names with the biggest Apple exposure include Cirrus Logic (CRUS)</strong>, which got 79% of its FY20 revenue from Apple, and <strong>Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)</strong>, which derived 56% of FY20 revenue from Apple. Others include <strong>QCOM </strong>and <strong>TSM</strong>.  </li></ul><p>Overall, this production goal from Apple is great news for the company. With Apple not offering guidance itself, we have to rely on articles like this one. This certainly confirms our belief that Apple's iPhone 12 sales have been robust and sets up what should be very strong DecQ numbers in late January. The main thing that could trip this up are component shortages, but demand certainly seems not be an issue.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "41639ad0-d790-4966-ba01-db35ee7f77cf", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4ed8bd5a536ae8b1b04b593a3e563607b3a4e9d6887b73f8d118d9d436e6d9a8", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3044, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "7df37e11-1558-40c7-8405-105402a06765"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb74e43e-8ad8-454c-b1ca-24d0f363d73a": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p><strong>Taiwan Semi (TSM +11%)</strong> is looking chipper today after the company reported robust Q4 results and provided upside guidance for Q1. As the world's largest contract chipmaker, and because TSM serves a broad range of end market applications, TSM is followed closely by the market during earnings season; its report provides a window into conditions in the overall semiconductor space.</p><p>  The upside was significant and was exhibited across the board in terms of the key metrics. EPS jumped 23% yr/yr to NT$5.51, which was a NT$1.01 beat. Of note, TSM posted greater than a NT$1.00 EPS beat in each quarter in 2020. Revenue rose 22% yr/yr and 4.4% sequentially to US$12.68 bln, which was at the high end of prior guidance of US$12.4-12.7 bln. Gross margin (54.0% vs 51.5-53.5% prior guidance) and operating margin (43.5% vs 40.5-42.5% prior guidance) were also both better than expected. </p><p>Chips for smartphones are TSM's largest market, representing about half of revenue. This segment saw a 13% sequential revenue increase in Q4. While not mentioned by TSM, we suspect <strong>Apple's (AAPL)</strong> 5G iPhone rollout had a lot to do with that. Offsetting that a bit was a 14% sequential decline in its second largest segment, HPC (high performance computing), which accounts for about a third of revenue. Automotive makes up just 3% of sales, but sales here jumped 27% sequentially. </p><p><strong>So, what are the key takeaways here?</strong> </p><ul><li>This report is great news for the semiconductor space generally. It shows that the shift to remote working and learning is leading to a surge in demand for advanced chips. </li><li>TSM's robust guidance for Q1 is a clear sign that the good times are expected to continue. TSM expects Q1 to be aided by HPC-related demand, recovery in the automotive segment, and milder smartphone seasonality than in recent years. Also, recall that last month, Nikkei Asia reported that Apple is planning to produce up to 96 mln iPhones in 1H21, a nearly 30% yr/yr increase. This guidance seems to support that reporting. </li><li>As important as TSM's headline numbers were for Q4 and guidance for Q1, we would argue that its robust 2021 capital budget of US$25-28 bln may be even more important in terms of gauging management's view going forward. Clearly, TSM management feels a need to expand its production capacity to keep up with robust demand. </li></ul><p>Overall, this Q4 report was great news for TSM and for the semiconductor industry generally, given TSM's huge size.

The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for non-GAAP EPS is $1.64 and for revenue it's $40.23 bln. Microsoft operates in several areas and it's important to know the breakdown by segment: Productivity and Business Processes (Office 365, LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, which are cloud-based ERP and CRM apps), Intelligent Cloud (Azure, SQL Server, Windows Server), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Surface, Xbox). </p><p>It's important to note that MSFT typically guides on the call by segment. For DecQ, MSFT has previously guided for its segments as follows: </p><ul><li><strong>Productivity and Business Processes (PBP)</strong> revenue of $12.75-13.00 bln. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365. LinkedIn should see an improved advertising market. </li><li> <strong>Intelligent Cloud (IC)</strong> revenue is expected at $13.55-13.80 bln. Azure growth will be driven by its consumption-based business while the per-user business should see growth moderate.  </li><li><strong>More Personal Computing (MPC)</strong> revenue of $13.20-13.60 bln. Windows will be lapping a strong prior year result. </li></ul><p><strong>A key area to watch will be Xbox sales as MSFT released a new console</strong> (Xbox Series X) this past holiday season for the first time in three years. Also, Microsoft's crown jewel has been its Azure cloud computing business which primarily competes Amazon's (AMZN) AWS service. In Q1 (Sep), Azure revenue rose a healthy 48%, a slight uptick from 47% growth in Q4 (Jun). Another bright spot has been Dynamics 365, which is a suite of ERP and CRM applications for businesses. It grew by 38% yr/yr in SepQ. </p><p><strong>MSFT tends to be very consistent in terms of beating consensus estimates</strong> with 18 EPS beats in a row, including double digit EPS beats in six of the past seven quarters, including a huge $0.46 beat in SepQ. </p><p><strong>A potential concern was from IBM's earnings report last week.</strong> IBM said that the pandemic and broader macro uncertainty has been putting additional pressure on larger software transactions and project delays.

The report that stands above the rest, though, belongs to Google parent <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>), which posted jaw-dropping 4Q20 numbers after the close yesterday.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Following FB's blowout report, which was fueled by a sharp acceleration in advertising spending, market participants certainly had an inkling that GOOG would exceed analysts' estimates. However, few expected the company to crush EPS forecasts by its largest margin in over five years ($22.30 vs. $15.98), with revenue growth ramping to 23.5% compared to the expectation of 13% growth.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">It takes a few different factors to beat estimates in such convincing fashion. For GOOG, the most prominent determinant is that advertising revenue has recovered at a much faster-than-anticipated pace. Rewinding to 2Q20, advertising revenue dropped by 8% as the pandemic caused businesses to rein in marketing expenses. During that earnings conference call, CEO Sundar Pichai struck a cautious tone, stating that the global economic environment remained fragile and that the outlook was uncertain due to the pandemic.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Last quarter, advertising budgets began to loosen as economies reopened. In GOOG's core search business (~55% of revenue), revenue climbed by 6.5%, driven by improvements in advertising spending across most verticals. This stabilization and recovery have quickly transitioned to a robust upswing, especially in the direct-response ad category.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">In total, advertising revenue jumped by 22% in Q4 to $46.2 bln, highlighted by a 47% surge in YouTube revenue to $6.9 bln. Like FB, GOOG is benefiting from the powerful secular trend of consumers moving more activity online, including shopping and buying. In turn, businesses are pouring more marketing dollars into digital channels.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">While the GOOG Services segment (Search, YouTube Ads) experienced a major revival in growth, Google Cloud continued its rapid expansion. For the quarter, cloud revenue increased by 46% to $3.83 bln, with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) generating growth that was significantly above cloud overall. GCP is a suite of cloud computing services that provides infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and server-less computing environments.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial,", "doc_id": "a6f026dc-be48-46d3-addd-90b8df67cccd", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "278025adac0837cc25c725858a285eab33f936557c11eb5cb45d946af9583417", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3425, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "00e45b2e-1d62-452f-b268-2ebadeb32107", "3": "28f12520-cb1f-46ff-8bf6-deb0512a1bd3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "28f12520-cb1f-46ff-8bf6-deb0512a1bd3": {"__data__": {"text": "style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">For the first time, GOOG broke out additional financial data for the cloud segment. Notably, the company disclosed that the business isn't profitable despite the high growth rate, posting an operating loss of $1.24 bln for the quarter. The company is still heavily investing in its cloud business and has tripled the size of its sales force, so the lack of profitability isn't overly surprising or concerning. Over time, GOOG expects cloud's operating margin to improve as it benefits from increased scale.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Lastly, total operating expenses declined by 4% yr/yr due to lower R&amp;D spending and from cutbacks GOOG made at the onset of the pandemic.

Such was the case yesterday when the GPU maker issued one of the strongest prints in its history. EPS and revenue surged by 64% and 61%, respectively, to easily surpass consensus estimates.<br><br>An impressive report was fully anticipated, however, evidenced by the ~12% rally in the stock this month. In fact, any result short of a blowout, coupled with robust 1Q21 guidance, would have been viewed as a major disappointment, causing a likely plunge in the stock.<br><br>Heading into the report, the primary concern was that the well-documented supply constraints within the semiconductor industry would prevent NVDA from fully meeting demand. Recall that during the 3Q20 earnings call, CFO Colette Kress stated that capacity constraints could hinder the company's ability to get gaming chips into consumers' hands, adding that it could take a few months for product availability to catch up with demand.<br><br>As NVDA's stellar performance indicates, supply shortages did not have a material impact on Q4 results. Kress acknowledged as much, commenting that although supply is tight, the company can meet demand and that additional supply increases are planned throughout 2021.<br><br>After the Data Center (DC) segment briefly took over the top spot in 2Q20, NVDA's core Gaming segment has reclaimed its leading position within the company. Bolstered by a spike in gaming popularity during the pandemic, the launch of new gaming consoles (PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch), and strong uptake for new GPUs, gaming revenue jumped by 67% yr/yr to $2.50 bln. In the earnings press release, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang credited the highly successful debut of its latest gaming GPUs, stating, \"Demand for GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs is incredible. NVIDIA RTX has started a major upgrade cycle as gamers jump to ray tracing, DLSS and AI.\"<br><br>Although growth tapered off to 97% from 162% last quarter, the story in NVDA's burgeoning DC unit remains mostly unchanged. The company has risen to prominence in the data center market as the infusion of AI technologies across cloud computing providers has created a windfall for the company.<br><br>If that wasn't enough, the boom in the cryptocurrency market is providing yet another growth catalyst for NVDA. Namely, miners have gravitated towards the company's RTX 3060 gaming chip to mine for cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum. The company estimates that mining contributed $100-300 mln to Q4 revenue, but it does not want its gaming GPUs to be used for mining. When cryptocurrencies skyrocketed in 2018, miners flooded the market for NVDA's gaming GPUs, causing the company to ramp up production. When the bottom fell out of the cryptocurrency market later that year, a substantial supply glut wreaked havoc on NVDA's gaming segment.<br><br>To prevent a similar occurrence from happening, NVDA is developing a dedicated mining product called the \"Cryptocurrency Mining Processor\", which will be available this quarter. Upgraded versions of the chip will launch in 2Q21.<br><br>The phrase \"an embarrassment of riches\" comes to mind when thinking about NVDA and its current state of affairs. Of all the semiconductor producers, NVDA is best suited to capitalize on several of the most powerful secular trends, including the rise of AI technology, the ongoing transition of data to the cloud, the emergence of autonomous driving, the increasing popularity of gaming, and cryptocurrencies.

Last Friday, IT security site <em>KrebsOnSecurity </em>reported that a Chinese hacking group called \"Hafnium\" allegedly exploited vulnerabilities in MSFT's Exchange Server, potentially impacting tens of thousands of companies and organizations.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">According to MSFT, the two hacking events are completely unrelated. Besides being attributed to different perpetrators, one key difference is that the SWI attack seemed to home in on larger enterprises and vital U.S. governmental agencies, such as the Department of Defense and the U.S. Treasury Department. While still very serious in nature, the MSFT breach is mostly impacting smaller and medium-sized businesses, as well as educational institutions, police departments, and local governments, among other groups.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">There's a logical explanation for why this hack is mostly affecting smaller organizations. The cyber criminals targeted four flaws within MSFT's Exchange Server email software, which operates Outlook-based email systems. Many smaller organizations, with more limited IT resources, are still running this email system on internal servers that may have weaker cybersecurity protections. On the other hand, many larger enterprises have transitioned to MSFT's cloud-based hosting services, which provide better safeguards.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Overall, this incident puts MSFT in a negative light, but it also makes a case for companies to move to its cloud offerings. The company's Intelligence Cloud (IC) segment, which includes Azure, Windows Server, and SQL Server, has been MSFT's standout performer. In Q4, IC revenue jumped by 34% to $16.7 bln.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">In a general sense, this attack once again illustrates how IT security threats continue to increase in scope and severity. On a related note, shares of cybersecurity stocks, including <strong>Palo Alto Networks</strong> (<strong>PANW</strong>), <strong>ZScaler</strong> (<strong>ZS</strong>), <strong>Fortinet</strong> (<strong>FTNT</strong>), and <strong>FireEye</strong> (<strong>FEYE</strong>), are all trading higher on the session.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">MSFT is taking a major publicity hit today, and its stock is slightly lagging the broader market.

What immediately comes to mind is the possibility that the supply chain constraints that are impacting many chip makers could be filtering through to AAPL's production output.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Supply chain issues may be playing a role in a 1H21 production adjustment, but a closer look at the story reveals that AAPL isn't changing its FY21 iPhone production forecast of 230 mln phones, representing an 11.6% yr/yr increase. This takes much of the bite out of the scary looking headline, but there are some notable takeaways.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">For instance, it does appear that AAPL overestimated demand for the iPhone 12 Mini as many customers instead opt for the older iPhone 11 model. Although all iPhone 12 versions are 5G-enabled, the current 5G capabilities are limited because the network is still being built out. This factor, combined with its larger screen, has made the iPhone 11 a better deal than the iPhone 12 Mini in the eyes of some consumers.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Most importantly, demand for other iPhone 12 models, including Pro and Pro Max, remains healthy. In fact, the report states that some components that were originally targeted for the Mini are now being reallocated to the other iPhone 12 models.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another key point is that it's quite possible that AAPL purposely overestimated 1H21 production in order to ensure that its suppliers locked up enough components during this chip shortage. Late last year, AAPL told suppliers to plan for 96 mln phones built in 1H21. Now, the company reportedly expects about 75 mln units to be built in 1H21, which is still slightly above 1H20 levels. <br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Clearly, Wedbush isn't concerned about the situation, as the research firm just added AAPL to its \"Best Ideas List.\" Indeed, a steep drop-off in demand would have been a very surprising development coming off AAPL's impressive Q1 report on January 27. For the quarter, iPhone revenue jumped by 18% to $65.6 bln, comfortably surpassing the $59.9 bln estimate. <br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">If chip shortages persist into the summer months, then a potential risk could arise for AAPL. However, the current expectation in the semiconductor industry is that supply constraints will ease later this year. Therefore, we view today's AAPL news as mostly benign, with a very limited impact on its fundamental picture.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "ed1346df-af5a-4543-9275-0b9fb86c3d88", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f8c62e0ac63c1c44061c4e19eaf2070d84b124ade08923b1db6d7b4c867d62bc", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3475, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "aa48208c-6a4c-4ddb-811b-b1bcc60baffa"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f62038f-8b2f-4cba-a796-36a7b386a0db": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT +2%)</strong> reportedly is chatting it up with Discord, an online chat platform popular with video game communities, according to <a bhref=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/microsoft-said-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-discord-for-more-than-10b?srnd=premium&amp;sref=QY7kFAuy\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a>. The article says Discord has been talking to several potential buyers, but no deal is imminent. Discord has a free service that lets gamers and other users communicate by video, voice, and text, according to the article, but MSFT might be looking to bundle Discord's premium offering, Nitro, into its Game Pass service to drive subscription revenue. </p><p> <strong>Briefing.com's take on a potential deal:</strong> </p><ul><li>A deal like this might strike some investors as odd. Microsoft has been focused mostly on enterprise corporate clients. While it has exposure on the consumer side with its popular Xbox, Minecraft, and Surface businesses, MSFT does not really have much exposure on the social media front. Granted, Discord is not precisely social media, but its chat format bears resemblance to other social platforms. </li><li>Recall that Microsoft expressed interest in acquiring TikTok last August and also in acquiring <strong>Pinterest (PINS)</strong> in early 2021, according to FT.com. A deal for Discord would be much smaller, but it shows a real desire from MSFT to want to engage more deeply with consumers. </li><li>The article mentions a potential $10 bln price, which would be a quite small deal for MSFT - much smaller than other deals it was exploring. </li><li> We do not think the timing is a coincidence after MSFT launched its long-awaited new gaming console last November: Xbox Series X and Series S. The launch was Xbox's most successful ever. Gaming is as popular now as it's ever been, fueled by people spending more time at home. </li><li>Xbox already has a large and growing consumer subscription business. However, the deal would really bolster Xbox's subscription revenue. Xbox Live has more than 100 mln monthly active users, while Game Pass now has 18 mln subscribers. Bundling in Nitro would add a nice boost to subscription revenue as it'd be an easy upsell to Xbox's huge existing user base. </li><li> Xbox users can use Discord already, but Microsoft owning the platform would really allow Xbox to build it into its ecosystem. </li></ul><p>Overall, we think it's just a matter of time before Microsoft makes a big splash on the social media front, particularly given that MSFT's interest in Discord reportedly follows consideration of TikTok and Pinterest. Clearly, the company wants to tap into a platform with deep engagement with consumers. All we can say is do not underestimate Microsoft. Recall that it was once criticized for focusing too much on software loaded on PCs and was late to the game on cloud computing. However, its Azure cloud computing service is now a powerhouse.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "4f62038f-8b2f-4cba-a796-36a7b386a0db", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "226d9b1a296c5780c7b249aaac50160735fea734fea676426931d10e37fd4bdc", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3042, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "e6b11b0a-b374-459d-9bbf-7c63c6cdd847"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1692a8c9-8bd0-46e6-ac8b-b6d5433a3945": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body>The global semiconductor shortage, which has already cost auto manufacturers <strong>General Motors</strong> (<strong>GM</strong>) and <strong>Ford</strong> (<strong>F</strong>) billions in lost production, has apparently taken a turn for the worse and is now spilling over into the consumer electronics market. According to <em>Nikkei Asia</em>, <strong>Apple</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) is postponing production of some MacBooks and iPads due to supply chain constraints, illustrating that even the most prominent companies with the best procurement abilities are now being impacted by the shortage.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Despite the seemingly alarming news, investors are taking the development in stride. The calm reaction is likely attributed to the belief that any lost sales from production delays will be made up later in the year when the supply imbalance is corrected. On a related note, last month GM announced that it extended downtime at select plants because of the chip shortage but that it also anticipates recovering lost car and crossover production in 2H21.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Additionally, the story doesn't come as a huge surprise. In mid-March, major AAPL supplier <strong>Samsung</strong> (<strong>SSNLF</strong>) warned of the serious supply/demand imbalance that's occurring in the semiconductor industry. Not coincidentally, Nikkei's article specified that AAPL is experiencing shortages in displays and display components, which SSNLF supplies to AAPL.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">There's also a sense that the supply chain constraint will iron itself out as more chip production eventually comes online. Recall that <strong>Taiwan Semi</strong> (<strong>TSM</strong>), the world's largest chip producer, recently announced plans to invest $100 bln over the next three years to expand its capacity. <strong>Intel</strong> (<strong>INTC</strong>) soon followed suit, announcing on March 24 that the company will spend $20 bln to build two new factories in Arizona. It will take some time for these new plants to begin production, but the mere concept that a substantial influx of supply is needed to meet rapidly rising demand isn't the worst scenario to contemplate. <br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Indeed, the semiconductor industry is experiencing a tidal wave of demand from multiple arenas, all at the same time. The work-from-home trend created a surge in sales for PCs and personal electronics, while the ever-increasing amount of data stored on the cloud is causing a burst in demand for chips from data center providers. These shocks to the supply chain left auto OEMs in a pinch when vehicle sales ramped higher due to pent-up demand following plant and showroom closures. Now, as chip makers tend to the auto industry's needs, it appears that the consumer electronics industry is being squeezed. <br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">While the chip", "doc_id": "1692a8c9-8bd0-46e6-ac8b-b6d5433a3945", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "532525f1bff3e236bb7c30164acf62ce0cf84fbf1bef059e47ddc1ca0f62897f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3570, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "e197b4f9-705a-4a8c-95d2-3fa8b1a88d43", "3": "ccb15cfd-7191-452d-8a4e-f5073de790c5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ccb15cfd-7191-452d-8a4e-f5073de790c5": {"__data__": {"text": "Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">While the chip shortages may cause some temporary headaches for AAPL and potentially for its customers in the coming months, the broader outlook remains quite favorable in our view.

Earlier this morning, those rumblings were confirmed after the companies announced that a deal was signed at that price in an all-cash transaction valued at nearly $20 bln. <br><br>At $56/share, MSFT is paying a 23% premium to last Friday's closing price for NUAN. That's a healthy increase, but we view the price tag as quite reasonable. Based on current analyst estimates for NUAN, the software giant is paying roughly 10-11x forecasted FY22 revenue. In today's climate, it's common for a cloud software stock to trade with a P/S north of 20x.<br><br>NUAN's recent financial performance and growth don't necessarily warrant a sky-high valuation, but the arrow is pointing up as the company completes its transition to focus on cloud-based healthcare offerings. Over the past few years, NUAN has trimmed its portfolio, divesting its medical transcription and EHR services business, its imaging division, and its automotive AI unit, among others. Simultaneously, the company has been transitioning its customer base away from on-premise products toward cloud-based systems, creating a stronger recurring revenue business model in the process.<br><br>This transition has come at a cost. In seven of the last eight quarters, NUAN's top line has declined on an yr/yr basis. The prognosis isn't much better for FY21, with analysts forecasting a 7% drop in revenue. However, the outlook is much brighter for next year, as revenue is projected to grow by 7% to $1.5 bln.<br><br>With most of the heavy lifting behind NUAN regarding its transformation, MSFT's acquisition proposal seems well-timed. The addition of the streamlined NUAN will instantly bolster MSFT's presence in the healthcare sector, which is a space that the company is increasingly focusing on. For instance, MSFT launched Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare last year, enabling healthcare organizations to coordinate care and drive operating efficiency, while providing security, compliance, and interoperability of health data.<br><br>Although MSFT is a relative newcomer to the healthcare space, the addition of NUAN is expected to double its total addressable market to nearly $500 bln.<br><br>The crown jewels of the acquisition are NUAN's Dragon Medical One (DMO) and Dragon Ambient Experience (DAX) cloud offerings.

It's well-understood that GOOG's search and advertising businesses are perfectly aligned to capitalize on these developments, given that many companies within those recovering spaces use GOOG for marketing purposes. Consequently, this meant that GOOG needed to hurdle an even higher bar than last quarter to keep the stock moving higher.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Amazingly, the company did just that, obliterating the top and bottom-line forecasts as total revenue surged by 34% yr/yr, marking its strongest growth rate in over five years. The recovery seen in advertising spending blossomed into a full-blown resurgence, while GOOG's cloud segment continues to produce strong double-digit growth.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Google advertising, which includes search and YouTube ads, exhibited accelerating momentum, with revenue up 32% to $44.7 bln (~81% of total revenue) compared to 22% growth in Q4. During the earnings conference call, CFO Ruth Porat acknowledged that the increase was partly due to the lapping of the initial impact of the pandemic that hit in March. However, she also stated that GOOG experienced broad-based increases in advertising spending, with the retail and tech categories standing out.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Travel is another key industry for GOOG that is showing significant improvement. Earlier in this earnings season, major carriers like <strong>Delta Air Lines</strong> (<strong>DAL</strong>), <strong>Southwest Air</strong> (<strong>LUV</strong>), and <strong>United Airlines</strong> (<strong>UAL</strong>) reported that demand for leisure travel has returned in a meaningful way. Last night, GOOG's Chief Business Officer, Philipp Schindler, echoed that sentiment, stating that the company is seeing renewed interest for travel as users turn to GOOG to plan their next trip before they're ready to book. In turn, airlines, hotels, travel booking companies, entertainment venues, and other travel-related companies are ramping up advertising spending to capitalize on consumers' increasing search activity.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Meanwhile, YouTube continues to shine as momentum builds in direct response advertising.

In fact, the 45% top-line growth generated in Q1 essentially matched last quarter's 46% figure. According to CEO Sundar Pichai, a few different trends are driving growth in the could segment, including strong customer momentum in the data cloud, the desire from customers to create operational efficiencies and to reduce IT costs, and the rise of hybrid cloud environments. <br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">These catalysts are expected to continue into the foreseeable future, prompting GOOG to ramp up its investments in its cloud offerings.

MSFT reported strong upside relative to prior guidance in all three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office 365, LinkedIn, Dynamics 365), Intelligent Cloud (Azure, SQL Server, Windows Server), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Surface, Xbox). What really stands out is that MSFT saw an acceleration in growth in almost every area relative to its Q2 (Dec) results. </li><li>In the company's Commercial business, accelerating digital transformations, as enabled by Microsoft Cloud, drove demand for its hybrid and cloud offerings. MSFT says Azure consumption, increased platform commitments, and higher usage of Teams and security offerings were key beneficiaries. Within its small and medium business (SMB) segment, continued improvement in cloud purchasing trends offset transactional licensing weakness. Meanwhile, LinkedIn improved with the job market. </li><li> In its Consumer business, MSFT noted that Windows OEM and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions benefited from a stronger than expected market for PCs, despite significant ongoing supply chain constraints. An improving advertising market benefited its Search and LinkedIn businesses. Finally, gaming continued to see record engagement and strong monetization as demand exceeded supply for the company's Xbox Series X and S consoles. </li><li>Azure revenue grew 50% yr/yr vs 50% growth in DecQ and 48% growth in SepQ.

Over the past year, tens of millions of iPads and Macs have been sold to help students learn and employees work remotely. </li><li>It was great to see Mac sales snap back with a huge quarter. Mac sales were a bit light in DecQ, likely on some pull-forward sales in SepQ due to back-to-school and remote learning. However, taking the three most recent quarters together, this was Mac's best three-quarter period ever. </li><li> One area of disappointment may be Apple's decision to continue not providing guidance. On the call, the company guided to strong double-digit revenue growth, but the outlook was not very specific.

Sometimes Apple can stumble a bit, like it did last quarter with Macs, but MarQ was uniformly good. The iPhone 12 launch was a big success that spilled over into MarQ. Our one concern is whether we'll see any turbulence in Mac and iPad sales in the next few quarters as we lap the start of the pandemic. This is where guidance would have been very helpful.

This is especially true in the data center market&nbsp;as the infusion of AI technologies across cloud computing providers has created a windfall for the company. Last quarter, NVDA's Data Center (DC) segment posted growth of 97%, which actually represented a slowdown from Q3's 162% surge.&nbsp;<br><br>Traditionally, NVDA is known for making graphics chips for gaming systems. However, NVDA's gaming segment has recently jockeyed back-and-forth with the DC segment for the top spot within the company. This development speaks more to the emergence of the DC unit than it does to a slowdown in the gaming segment. In fact, gaming revenue jumped by an impressive 67% last quarter to $2.5 bln (~50% of total revenue), due to the increasing popularity of gaming during the pandemic and the launch of new gaming consoles&nbsp;(PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch).<br><br>NVDA's outstanding performance and robust growth has produced a rich valuation for the stock, illustrated by the ~44x forward P/E. NVDA bulls argue that the lofty valuation is supported by the company's considerable growth opportunities, including in the automotive and high-performance computing (HPC) markets. In particular, the company is gaining a strong foothold in autonomous driving and Robotaxis, estimating that its design-win pipeline for NVIDIA DRIVE technology totals more than $8 bln over the next six years.&nbsp;<br><br>Recall that NVDA made a major splash in the M&amp;A market with its $40 bln proposed acquisition of Arm Holdings last September.

This is an interesting and somewhat surprising development given that the acquisition is facing major antitrust scrutiny from regulators.

By exceeding the EPS forecast by $0.38 ($3.66 vs. $3.28), the answer lies somewhere in between as NVDA still comfortably outperformed projections, but not as impressively as the remarkable $1.12 and $0.99 beats it registered in Q4 and Q3.<br><br>With the stock up 80% yr/yr, resulting in a frothy 1-year forward P/E of 44x, the more down-to-earth performance is one reason why shares aren't reacting more favorably. Another reason, though, is that there's some concern that demand from cryptocurrency miners for its gaming chips is inflating its growth. During the earnings call last night, CFO Colette Kress commented, \"We believe gaming also benefited from crypto mining demand, although it's hard to determine to what extent.\"<br><br>This is a potential issue because crypto-related demand can be fleeting due to the highly volatile nature of the crypto market. In 2018, when the crypto market tumbled, NVDA faced a severe supply and demand imbalance for its gaming chips as crypto miners vanished. To prevent a similar scenario from unfolding again, NVDA launched a new line of crypto currency mining processors (CMPs), while also limiting the mining ability of its gaming chips.<br><br>Sales of its CMPs came in at $155 mln in Q1, but NVDA was unable to peg the amount of crypto-related sales of gaming chips. <br><br>However, with revenue surging by 106% yr/yr to $2.76 bln, it's clear that business is booming with or without the cryptocurrency impact. From a broader viewpoint, the rising popularity of gaming that emerged during the pandemic continues to provide a potent tailwind. More specific to NVDA, the company's line of RTX graphics cards is red-hot and are being embedded into a rapidly increasing number of laptops.  In fact, over 140 laptops on the market are now powered by NVDA's second-generation RTX graphics.<br><br>Meanwhile, NVDA's burgeoning Data Center (DC) segment continues to shine with revenue up 79% yr/yr to a quarterly record of $2.05 bln. Kress highlighted strength from hyperscale customers as a key source of growth as they continue to build out infrastructure to commercialize artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities. Additionally, its A100 chip is experiencing healthy demand from cloud providers, including <strong>Google</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>), which are using the technology for varying areas of AI, such as language understanding/processing and recommendation systems.<br><br>There's little evidence that a slowdown for NVDA is on the horizon, illustrated by its upside Q2 revenue guidance of $6.174-$6.426 bln (+63% at midpoint) vs. the $5.48 bln consensus estimate. Kress did acknowledge that NVDA expects to remain supply constrained into 2H21, but the company seems to be navigating around the component shortages effectively.

Investors are cheering the acquisition despite a lack of details surrounding the deal. It should be finalized around 3Q21 (Oct). </p><p> Nvidia is best known for its gaming chips, but its Automotive segment may be poised to become its next catalyst. Map data is considered the biggest hurdle for self-driving technology as autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to operate with centimeter-level precision. We see the acquisition of DeepMap as another step in the right direction for Nvidia. </p><p> Nvidia's Automotive segment has been quiet over the past year, with revenues flat since 1Q20 (Apr). In addition, Automotive only makes up 2.7% of total revenue, a decline from 5% of total revenue in 1Q20. This decline is primarily from Gaming and Data Center revenue growth nearly doubling yr/yr. However, we think that Automotive could represent a sleeping giant for Nvidia, which develops its DRIVE system-on-a-chip (SoC) as an AI SoC that can be used for autonomous driving. We think this could soon have a more profound impact on the company's top line. </p><p> <strong>Here are reasons why we are bullish on Nvidia's Automotive segment: </strong></p><ul><li>Nvidia's automotive design win pipeline exceeds $8 bln through FY27, with global adoption already achieved throughout the transportation industry. Nvidia currently has over 370 DRIVE partners. </li><li>Furthermore, its DRIVE platform has yet to reach mass production. Car manufacturers such as Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and Nio have announced their intent to use Nvidia's DRIVE platform for many of their premium vehicles beginning in 2022. Also, the DRIVE platform will be expanded to larger commercial fleets, including robotaxis and semi-trucks. </li><li> Nvidia's DRIVE platform can also be used for features other than self-driving, such as safety and AI-enabled infotainment centers, enabling adoption in entry-level cars. For example, Hyundai is deploying Nvidia's DRIVE platform across its entire fleet beginning in late 2021 for its infotainment system. </li></ul><p> Overall, building off the technology Nvidia has developed in its GPUs, the company is in a prime position to take full advantage of the shift to autonomous driving. Analysts are expecting about 50% revenue growth for FY22, and given that Nvidia's commentary on its guidance primarily focuses on Gaming and Data Center, much of its Automotive potential may not be getting priced in. Finally, although supply constraints remain a concern, we think that since Nvidia and most auto manufacturers forecast this hurdle to ease by 2H21, it should not affect the mass rollout of DRIVE in auto manufacturers' 2022 model year vehicles.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "2af529a6-37fa-4d1f-b10d-714b11402210", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5e7d8117f992f5225e706f2a6fb114932fe41b8b5bbc9874417d66832aa3b5dd", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2905, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "30b49534-4c30-442a-b179-1d32adc1806e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9724198-fcf5-4596-8ffc-29d6a00c10c5": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><strong>Alphabet</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) is displaying some modest weakness and is contributing to a more negative tone in the market today following a report that New York and 37 other states filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company. At the center of the lawsuit is the Google Play Store, which New York Attorney General Letitia James says is using anticompetitive tactics, including exclusionary contracts, to muscle out other mobile app distributors.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Among several different allegations, the litigation claims that GOOG implements technical barriers that strongly discourage or completely prevent app developers from distributing their apps outside the Google Play Store. Also being called into question is that GOOG's required contracts ensure that its apps be \"pre-loaded\" on virtually every device that runs on the Android OS.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">For its part, GOOG is dismissing the lawsuit as \"meritless\", stating that it essentially mirrors the litigation brought forward by Epic Games, the developer of the ultra-popular Fortnite game. GOOG argues that anyone can download an app from any competing app store, or directly from the developer's website, using the Android OS. However, Epic Games says that <strong>Apple</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) and GOOG force developers to use their payment systems, which charge steep commissions on all purchases.

Along with tech giant counterparts like AAPL, <strong>Facebook</strong> (<strong>FB</strong>), and <strong>Amazon</strong> (<strong>AMZN</strong>), GOOG is under a global microscope as governments around the world impose an antitrust crackdown. The Chinese government and the measures it has taken against <strong>Alibaba</strong> (<strong>BABA</strong>) and <strong>Didi Global</strong> (<strong>DIDI</strong>) have garnered plenty of attention, but that country is certainly not alone in its mission to reign in massive tech companies.<br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">For instance, France has taken aim at GOOG, fining the company $268 mln in early June for antitrust issues.

Given that impressive run, a mild quarter is not going to create much enthusiasm with investors. It also comes as a bit of a shock given all the headlines surrounding chip shortages. </p><p> As the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSM serves a broad range of end-market applications, such as smartphones (42% of revenue), high-performance computers (39%), and automotive (4%), and supplies titans in their respective industries, such as <strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong>, <strong>NVIDIA (NVDA)</strong>, and <strong>GM (GM)</strong>. TSM is followed closely by the market during earnings season because its results paint a picture of conditions in the overall semiconductor space. </p><ul><li> EPS still grew 11.2% yr/yr despite missing analysts' expectations. However, this amounts to only about half the growth rate experienced in FY20. Revenue experienced healthy growth of 19.8% yr/yr to NT$372.15 bln, which was relatively in-line with the consensus. Gross margin remained at 50%, which is TSM's long-term target. </li><li> Regarding the automotive semiconductor shortage, TSM increased output for MCUs -- a key component in automotive semiconductor products -- in 1H21 by about 30% more than in 1H20. It also expects to ramp up full-year output by 60% more than in 2020. TSM cited that the production increases should significantly reduce the semiconductor shortage for its automotive customers. </li><li>Looking ahead, TSM's upside revenue guidance for Q3 is $1.45 bln more at the mid-point than consensus. Also, Q3-Q4 are typically TSM's best quarters, as during that period, one of its largest customers, Apple, rolls out new iPhones, and students begin purchasing new computers with <strong>AMD (AMD)</strong> and NVDA chipsets for the fall. </li><li> However, despite more students returning to the classrooms and new iPhones pending release this fall, we do not expect similarly-sized 2H20 EPS beats in 2H21. Many students would have purchased computers last year, as they were necessary for remote learning; plus, there isn't much new groundbreaking technology within AMD processors and NVDIA GPUs.

Also, NVDA expects demand for its chips in these segments to outpace supply for the vast majority of next year. </p><ul><li> Nonetheless, the stock has been up and down today. Although NVDA continued to post impressive revenue growth of over 35% across each of its four main segments, its $0.02 earnings beat snapped a streak of seven consecutive double-digit earnings beats. Furthermore, NVDA's earnings of $1.04 per share are its lowest since 1Q19. In addition, we think investors are becoming more concerned about frothy valuations. NVDA trades at 48x forward earnings, pegging the company at a premium over competitors AMD (AMD, 41x forward earnings) and Intel (INTC, 10.9x forward earnings). </li><li> However, there were still many bright spots in Q2. Every segment but Automotive set new revenue records, driving total revenue growth to 68% yr/yr to $6.51 bln. Professional Visualization led, more than doubling at 156% yr/yr and jumping 40% sequentially to $519 mln. This segment is starting to gain a lot of traction, especially as talk of the \"metaverse\" heats up. For example, NVDA's Omniverse platform, its real-time simulation and collaboration platform that provides the foundation of the metaverse, has now seen over 50,000 creators downloading the platform since it launched in December. With companies such as <strong>Facebook (FB)</strong> and <strong>Roblox (RBLX) </strong>pouring resources into shaping this virtual world, we think the metaverse could become a significant revenue component for NVDA going forward. </li><li>In Gaming, revenue grew 85% yr/yr and 11% sequentially to $3.06 bln. NVDA stated that it has difficulty quantifying crypto's effect on its gaming revenue, as its GPUs can be used to mine cryptocurrency. However, we think NVDA's technological advantage in graphics processing over its competitors positions the company for continued gains even if the crypto market were to fall, especially as the pandemic ignited a greater shift toward gaming. </li><li>Data Center growth yr/yr did cool off in Q2, growing 35% yr/yr to $2.37 bln after increasing 79% in Q1. However, Data Center revenue was lapping one of its biggest gains last year when revs rocketed 167%. Again, we think NVDA's GPU technology in this space is ahead of the competition, given that its Data Center revs of $2.37 bln are greater than AMD's Computing and Graphics segment (which includes its gaming and data center revenue) of $2.25 bln. </li><li>Finally, Automotive was the laggard in Q2, growing 37% yr/yr but falling 1% sequentially to $152 mln. We remain bullish on NVDA's automotive segment and believe it can be a significant catalyst as the automotive industry moves increasingly toward autonomous driving and more complex infotainment systems. </li></ul><p>Overall, despite not being reflected in the price action today, NVDA's Q2 performance and its outlook on its many businesses demonstrated why it is considered a top-flight growth name in the semiconductor industry. We are not overly concerned about NVDA's bearish view on cryptocurrency mining, especially as NVDA remains a leader in many other industries where the company's focus lies. We think pullbacks in the stock can act as nice entry points for buy-and-hold investors.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "1cf5a158-4ee7-446c-b984-244744f58329", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1a4285c81c87a0fdf493edca4a3d2735d4c2cdbdca57add64b4652e5c21360fd", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3839, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "64c93ef2-516a-41ba-a99b-5df39e8414a2"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "457d388a-db35-4d80-a6e4-7d561d9d800e": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p> <strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong> is set to host its annual iPhone event today at 1:00 p.m. ET, at which the most valuable US-based company is expected to launch a new Apple Watch and redesigned AirPods along with a new edition of its most valuable product, the iPhone. It appears that only limited improvements are expected for the iPhone, including the usual (better battery, camera, processor) plus expanded storage, a smaller notch, improved MagSafe, and new colors. A similar theme goes for the Apple Watch 7, which is expected to receive a slightly bigger screen (~1 mm), reduced bezels, and extended battery life.</p><p>  iPhone is where AAPL makes the bulk of its revenue (~49% in Q3), with Services (~21%), which includes AppleCare and digital content, quickly making up a large overall piece of total revenue. Each of AAPL's other segments - Mac, iPad, and Wearables and Accessories - makes up about 10% of revenue. Although the company's iPhone event today should unveil only minor changes to the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods relative to models from the year before, we think certain additional factors at play could continue to provide a tailwind for AAPL moving forward. Wearables and Accessories may only make up about 10% of total revs, but this segment grew revenues faster than every other segment on a two-year stack in Q3 (Jun). </p><ul><li>Wearable and Accessories leaped 58.8% in Q3 from 2019 while iPhone and Services grew 52.2% and 52.6% from 2019, respectively. Already on the iPhone, 5G will likely play a massive role in driving growth for internet of things (IoT) devices, such as the Apple Watch (which is included in Wearables and Accessories). This is because 5G can provide real-time updates through its low latency and high-speed connectivity. </li><li>AAPL is continuously developing and innovating augmented reality (AR). With the iPhone 12 last year, AAPL brought LiDAR (first introduced on its iPad in early 2020) to iPhone. LiDAR is crucial to AR, as it enables accurate environment maps to be created nearly instantly instead of by detecting the room one wall, table, etc., at a time. AR is already being developed for mapping outer space and assisting self-driving vehicles. Also, companies such as <strong>Facebook (FB)</strong> and <strong>Walmart (WMT) </strong>are looking for developers to build new AR applications, showing the ramping up of demand in the AR space. </li><li>Lastly, it was reported that AAPL would be using the <strong>Qualcomm (QCOM)</strong> X60 chip, which allows for emergency satellite calls. Although it may only be implemented in select markets, we think that bringing this technology, which is only found on bulky satellite-connected phones, to the consumer phone industry allows for massive potential. If AAPL continues to expand upon this tech, it could be indicative of the company setting its sights on disrupting the traditional telecom industry. </li></ul><p>Bottom line, the iPhone event today should bring modest changes that may only excite tech-enthusiasts and Apple fans. However, for buy-and-hold investors, we think AAPL's iPhone event plays a critical role in detailing the company's strategic direction. As certain technologies continue to be developed, AAPL could be the company to bring them to the mainstream. On a final note, the stock tends to see a bit of a sell-the-news reaction to these events, so it would be unusual to see a big move in the stock today.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "457d388a-db35-4d80-a6e4-7d561d9d800e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "967d90d799294cf28083c59393a2bd70ce1b36868d472cce733942a7a3dfb26e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3522, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "bb276202-e3e1-4dad-904e-17f332d46830"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f2a24df-1a76-4555-ad3f-169a60289a59": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body>As global economic growth concerns rise, <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<strong>MSFT</strong>) is helping to swing sentiment towards a more bullish bias after announcing a massive new $60 bln share buyback program while also boosting its quarterly dividend higher by 11% to $0.62/share.

One such disclosure was that FB's own internal research showed that Instagram made one in three teenage girls feel worse about their body image. That same research also showed that 13% of British girls and 6% of U.S. girls attributed suicidal thoughts to Instagram. These discoveries prompted the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>to characterize the photo sharing app as \"toxic\" for teenage girls, a label that FB has vigorously fought back against.<br style=\"font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br style=\"font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Already in the crosshairs of politicians over anti-competitive concerns, the firestorm created by this article adds another layer to FB's regulatory issues as its commitment to protecting kids is scrutinized.

The social media giant believes that the article misrepresented its internal research by not reporting some of the positive aspects of the platform.

GOOG's plan was to directly compete with <strong>PayPal's (PYPL)</strong> Venmo and <strong>Square's (SQ)</strong> Cash App. It was part of a broader effort by GOOG to bolster its fintech offerings and further compete with many other fintech companies, such as <strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong>, <strong>Facebook (FB)</strong>, and <strong>Alibaba (BABA)</strong>. </p><p>We also think that it makes a lot of sense for GOOG to launch this type of app. </p><ul><li> For one, the pandemic has fueled a boom in contactless payment options.

Apple did not provide a lot of detail on the situation but did say that supply constraints during Q4 (Sep) would likely be greater than those seen in Q3 (Jun), with the constraints primarily impacting iPhone and iPad. The latest nodes, which Apple uses in several of its products, have not been much of an issue, but legacy nodes have been impacted by supply constraints on silicon. </li><li><strong>It also shows that even a tech behemoth like Apple is not immune</strong> to the global chip shortage. The timing of the shortage is unfortunate, as it's coming just as Apple unveiled the new iPhone 13 last month. Consumers should expect delays in getting their new iPhones. It's also bad news for Apple suppliers like <strong>SWKS, QRVO, CRUS, AVGO, TSM, QCOM, SMH, LPL, LITE, FNSR</strong>, and<strong> IIVI</strong>. </li><li>Apple declined to provide guidance with its JunQ report due to uncertainty, but this news is likely shave some analyst estimates for Q1 (Dec) and Q2 (Mar). iPhone is by far Apple's largest revenue generator (54% of total YTD sales). </li><li><strong>This is likely to be a theme with all sorts of companies when earnings season gets into high gear next week.</strong> Within tech, software companies are unlikely to be affected much, but we suspect most every hardware company will be warning about component shortages. </li></ul><p> <strong>With shortages being a given this earnings season, the key will be getting companies' takes on how long the challenges will last. Ford (F) </strong>was actually pretty positive this summer, saying that Q2 had been the low point and chips were flowing better in Q3. However, we think that rosy outlook may change. <strong>Cisco (CSCO)</strong>, a great bellwether for tech, expects challenges to continue through at least the first half of FY22 (ending January 31) and potentially into the second half of FY22 (July 2022). </p><p> <strong>Bottom line, this news is troubling to hear, though not totally unexpected </strong>based on Apple's July comments. We think that's why the stock is holding up fairly well. Supply challenges are going to be the main theme for lots of companies across many industries this earnings season. We think that's a given - the main issue now surrounds their duration. Investors should understand that this is going to multi-quarter problem, so investors should not look for a quick fix.

The company expects these trends to continue over the long term, which should help cushion TSM against a possible reversal in chip demand. </p><ul><li>In Q3, TSM reported EPS growth of 13.7% yr/yr to NT$6.03, topping analyst expectations by NT$0.25. Revs continued to grow by double-digits for the seventh consecutive quarter, jumping 16.3% yr/yr to NT$414.67 bln, also beating consensus. Gross margin increased considerably at 1300 bps sequentially to 51.3%, remaining above TSM's long-term target of at least 50%. </li><li>The largest revenue driver in Q3 was internet-of-things (IoT) devices. IoT revs soared 23% sequentially to NT$37.32 bln. Many industries are seeing IoT become a significant component of their businesses. For example, at connected healthcare company <strong>Hill-rom (HRC)</strong>, connected devices made up over a third of total revenue in the company's most recent quarter, up from just 20% one year ago. In addition, one of TSM's larger customers, <strong>Qualcomm (QCOM)</strong>, saw its IoT segment experience explosive growth of 83% yr/yr in the quarter ending June 30. </li><li>All but one of TSM's other segments also experienced sequential growth in Q3. TSM's largest segment, Smartphones, grew revs by 15%. TSM's next largest segment, HPC, rose 9%. But perhaps most notably, Automotive grew sequentially for the fourth consecutive quarter, seeing 5% growth in Q3. </li><li> Regarding Automotive, TSM stated that it expects supply shortages for its automotive customers to be \"greatly reduced\" starting this quarter. The company also mentioned that its part in the global automotive integrated circuit market is only about 15%, meaning that TSM's ability to supply its customers would only play a small role in helping automotive manufacturers keep up with demand. </li></ul><p> Overall, semiconductors will remain in short supply for at least the rest of 2021 and, as TSM has indicated, more than likely throughout 2022. However, long-term trends point to a sustained robust semiconductor market, especially as the pandemic accelerated the need to go digital, driving up demand for chips in many different industries. Investors also appear to be shrugging off what looks to be an effort by TSM to stockpile chips. However, this is a slight concern to us, as technology constantly evolves, with lifespans getting shorter. This is especially true in the automotive industry, where electric vehicle tech becomes outdated after just one year. </p><p> Nonetheless, we think that the megatrends TSM pointed to, such as 5G and HPC, should sustain the demand for TSM's products and their technological advantages over products from competitors such as <strong>Intel (INTC)</strong> over the long term. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "784f7ea3-2deb-4e4d-8878-0ebbe53fb41f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "612b8442bd1db9f4ccc8820e3c9508c64bc9841820341e40b5dc80f6d6dc0b9c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3541, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "98f5da3c-0a47-4334-9f58-5cf27f373102"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a6d367e-31b4-4735-bb48-9e5faef9330d": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body>Heading into <strong>Facebook's </strong>(<strong>FB</strong>) 3Q21 earnings report, a dizzying number of considerations swirled around its potential results, guidance, and the consequential stock reaction. At the top of the list was how <strong>Apple's </strong>(<strong>AAPL</strong>) iOS 14 update and the addition of its App Transparency Tracking tool stymied <strong>Snap's</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>) top-line performance and outlook, creating a red flag for FB's report. Casting additional apprehension has been the onslaught of negative stories in the press emanating from various whistleblowers. Given that FB already faces intense competitive pressures from SNAP and TikTok, the whistleblowers' testimonies regarding FB's alleged lack of concern about safety and security prompted speculation that FB could begin shedding a higher number of users.<br style=\"font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br style=\"font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">These issues, along with the ever-present antitrust and regulatory threats hanging over FB, are competing in a tug-of-war against the company's EPS beat, a new $50 bln stock repurchase program, and excitement regarding its investments in the metaverse.<br style=\"font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br style=\"font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">A $0.04 EPS beat may not seem like cause for celebration, especially since FB missed on the top line. The magnitude of the beat also pales in comparison to the upside seen in FB's previous five quarters, which included beats ranging from $0.42-0.98. Considering how far expectations had fallen, though, as reflected in the stock's 15% dive since early September, there's a sense of relief that FB's results weren't worse. Similarly, investors may be sensing that the worst effects of the iOS changes will be in the rearview mirror once the calendar flips to 2022.<br style=\"font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br style=\"font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">FB's guidance for Q4 was indeed soft, with the company forecasting revenue of $31.5-34.0 bln vs. the $34.8 bln consensus estimate. Headwinds from the iOS changes are expected to persist, but macroeconomic uncertainties (supply chain woes, shortages, inflation) were also cited, suggesting that FB anticipates a possible slowdown in ad spending this holiday season.<br style=\"font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br style=\"font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Although the near-term outlook remains a bit bleak, FB expressed its confidence in its long-term opportunities through the massive share buyback program. The company's bullish viewpoint hinges on its buildout and investments in the metaverse, a digital reality environment that CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes holds the future of communication.

A main reason why GOOG escaped relatively unscathed is that the company organically collects vast amounts of user data through its search engine, making it less vulnerable to users opting out of mobile online tracking through AAPL's App Transparency Tracking system. Therefore, GOOG is retaining more valuable information pertaining to buying intentions and habits than FB or SNAP, making its platform more attractive to advertisers.<br><br>This differentiating factor, along with a healthy spending environment, produced strong results once again for GOOG's advertising business, which was up 43% yr/yr to $53.1 bln. During the earnings conference call, CFO Ruth Porat noted that momentum for advertising spending was broad-based but that retail continued its trend of outperformance relative to other areas. The one platform that was slightly impacted by the iOS changes was YouTube, as its revenue growth slowed to 44% from 84% last quarter. That deceleration, however, is also due to YouTube lapping a challenging yr/yr period in which 3Q20 revenue increased by 32%.<br><br>Another advantage that GOOG has over FB and SNAP is its cloud computing business. Google Cloud revenue growth of 45% helped to further insulate the company from AAPL-related headwinds. Keeping with recent form, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) grew faster than overall cloud, with particular strength experienced in platform-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service.

Typically, as companies get larger, growth gets harder to come by, but MSFT is stepping on the gas. <strong>It's truly remarkable that a company this large can do that.</strong> </p><p>The company makes the argument that digital technology is a deflationary force in an inflationary economy. Businesses can improve productivity and the affordability of their products and services by building up tech intensity. Given the company's revenue acceleration, it's clear that businesses are buying into this idea. Microsoft Cloud grew 36% yr/yr to $20.7 bln, its first-ever $20+ bln quarter. </p><p>Before digging into the segments, investors should be aware that Windows 11 launched in early October, constituting the operating system's biggest update in a decade.

Better data should come in Q2 (Dec) as MSFT will launch Windows 11 in new PCs beginning this holiday season. </p><ul><li> <strong>Intelligent Cloud (IC)</strong> was by far the fastest growing segment, with revenue up 31% yr/yr to $17.0 bln vs prior guidance of $16.40-16.65 bln, driven by continued customer demand for hybrid and cloud offerings. Growth was fueled by Azure at 50% yr/yr, which was right in-line with growth posted in recent quarters: 51% in JunQ and 50% in MarQ.

MSFT saw a good performance in Windows OEM, driven by a stronger-than-expected PC market, particularly in the Commercial segment, and Gaming. </li><li> <strong>In its commercial business, Microsoft Cloud and Azure led the way.</strong> MSFT also saw increased usage across Teams and Power Platform. On the consumer side, Windows OEM performance was better than expected in a growing PC market, despite ongoing supply chain constraints. MSFT also saw positive demand signals for Windows 11 ahead of the launch, with nearly all devices built this quarter eligible for an upgrade. </li><li><strong>Finally, in gaming topics, </strong>MSFT did not even address Netflix's move into gaming. We do not get the sense MSFT is worried at all. In the Q2 holiday season, MSFT expects revenue growth in the high-single digits.

Furthermore, the quarter's revenue, despite being a SepQ record, was light of consensus for the first time since MarQ2017. </li><li><strong>Demand is not an issue; </strong>in fact, Apple described demand as robust in SepQ. The quarter's main challenge was larger than expected supply constraints. Apple estimates that these constraints had a $6 bln revenue impact, driven primarily by industry-wide silicon shortages and COVID-related manufacturing disruptions. Nevertheless, Apple set an all-time record for Mac sales and quarterly records for iPhone, iPad, Wearables, Home and Accessories, representing 30% yr/yr growth in products.

As a result, despite trading at 73x forward earnings and soaring over 120% YTD, the stock remains chipper, continuing to run higher after the company delivered its OctQ earnings. </p><ul><li> In Q3 (Oct), NVDA posted earnings upside of $0.06, coming in much better than the two-cent beat reported in Q2 (Aug). Although that earnings upside may seem light, when adjusting for NVDA's stock split, EPS leaped 60% yr/yr. Revenue showed similar strength, jumping 50.3% yr/yr to $7.1 bln, ahead of consensus. </li><li> One of the standouts from the quarter was Data Center growth, which continued to shine, soaring 55% yr/yr and 24% sequentially to $2.94 bln despite lapping +37% growth from the year-ago period. Data Center revenue keeps encroaching on Gaming as NVDA's main business, making up over 41% of total sales in Q3, up about 160 bps from a year ago. We think this segment could quickly surpass Gaming revenue consistently - it already has done so once, in Q2 of last year - given its higher use cases, such as AI services for speech recognition, anomaly detection, and other analysis. </li><li> Still, in Q3, Gaming remained ahead of Data Center with revs of $3.22 bln, a 42% jump yr/yr. NVDA's latest RTX GPUs are proving to be a success, as PC gaming's popularity has remained elevated even after the height of the pandemic. For example, <strong>Activision Blizzard (AVTI)</strong>, the company behind popular PC titles such as the Warcraft franchise, saw total net bookings increase 6% yr/yr in Q3 despite having already soared 46% in 3Q20. </li><li> NVDA also doubled membership for its cloud gaming offering, GeForce NOW, through the past year to over 14 mln. This gaming-as-a-service platform allows anyone with a good internet connection to play major releases regardless of a title's system requirements, which has offered players a fantastic alternative to purchasing expensive gaming consoles and PCs, especially given that PS5 and Xbox consoles and GPUs have remained in short supply. </li><li> Finally, Automotive was the laggard in the quarter, just as it was in Q2, as chip shortages continued to impact NVDA's automotive partners. Revs grew just 8% yr/yr and fell 11% sequentially due to declining AI cockpit revenue as auto manufacturers struggled to secure enough parts. </li></ul><p>Overall, with another quarter of record revenue under its belt, NVDA is continuing its remarkable run YTD as investors applaud the company's ability to keep its growth rate above 50% thus far in FY22.

That top-line miss was mainly driven by supply chain constraints, which the company estimated had a negative revenue impact of $6 bln.

Growth for the chip makers' bottom line was also strong; earnings rose 16% yr/yr to NT 6.41 per share, topping estimates by double digits. </p><p> Being the world's most valuable and largest semiconductor manufacturer, TSM paints a good picture of the overall semiconductor industry through its earnings report. <strong>As such, one of the most notable comments from TSM during its Q4 earnings call is that it expects capacity to remain tight throughout 2022 </strong>as many end markets, such as automotive, PC, data center, and mobile, are creating products with higher silicon content. Despite this tight capacity, TSM predicts that the foundry industry should grow close to 20% for the year. TSM is optimistic that it will outperform this expected industry growth. </p><ul><li>Another takeaway from Q4 is that operating margins grew by 50 bps yr/yr, slightly ahead of TSM's guidance, to 41.7%. Even more remarkably, the company expects margins to continue to improve in FY22, forecasting a range of 42-44%. </li><li> The low-to-mid percentage growth across most of TSM's business units contributed to the decent margin improvement in the quarter. One highlight came on the automotive side, where revs jumped 10% yr/yr. Although automotive only accounts for 4% of total Q4 revs, the jump is significant as it shows that the automotive industry is continuing on its path of recovery. Not only is the growth much higher than the minor 5% jump last quarter, but it also builds upon a leap of 27% already achieved in the year-ago period. </li><li>Looking ahead, we think a big contributor to the stock's movement today, along with the company's expectations for continued margin expansion in FY22, is TSM's Q1 revenue guidance. The company expects revenues of $16.6-17.2 bln for the quarter, smashing estimates. High-performance computing (HPC) is expected to be the driver behind sales growth, coupled with further recovery in automotive. Both should more than offset TSM's forecast of a milder smartphone season compared to recent years. </li><li> <strong>Lastly, TSM predicts that 5G and HPC applications will be major themes over the long term.</strong> Both industries should ignite a further jolt in the smartphone, automotive, and internet-of-things markets, given the enhanced capabilities 5G and HPC enable. TSM is thus guiding to long-term revenue (in USD) between 15-20% over the next several years. </li></ul><p><strong>Overall, TSM's Q4 results point to increasing demand for chips in many additional applications moving forward.</strong> We also like seeing that the automotive industry is continuing to recover. Although we were slightly concerned about TSM's efforts to seemingly stockpile chips in the previous quarter, given that a downturn could result in substantial losses, the company is continuing to secure prepayment from its customers, reducing this risk in the process. </p><p> Bottom line, we believe the 5G and HPC themes should play out nicely in FY22, setting up TSM for a strong year ahead.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "396e3db9-2bbe-480c-bdfa-8f3ab56fb8b3", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "37f784ace71aee7f2549e1b646420be341d9cb2b6f1e5802ff594ed8f7e1fc1f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3261, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "8fb96a41-df72-444e-ab3e-2edade55eae7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4b3dfce-00f5-44d0-9686-65444cb80eed": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p><strong>Activision Blizzard (ATVI +28%)</strong> is setting a high score today after tech Goliath <strong>Microsoft (MSFT -1%)</strong> announced plans to purchase the video game publisher for $95.00 per share, valuing the company at $68.7 bln. Using last Friday's closing price, MSFT is paying a roughly 45% premium to acquire multiple gaming franchises from ATVI, including <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>World of Warcraft</em>, and <em>Candy Crush</em>. With estimated FY21 revs of $8.7 bln, ATVI is one of the largest US-based video game publishers by revenue, outperforming <strong>Electronic Arts (EA) </strong>and <strong>Take-Two (TTWO)</strong>. The deal translates to MSFT paying about 7.9x ATVI's FY21 revenue. </p><p>MSFT, in addition to gaining ATVI's portfolio of popular releases, is also acquiring 390 mln global monthly active ATVI users. This total encompasses users across all consoles, PC, and mobile, meaning there will be some overlap, but the metric is still significant. Some of ATVI's future titles could become exclusives for the Xbox console and PC, which could up MSFT's Xbox Live subscription numbers in the process. As of 2Q21 (Dec), the last time MSFT disclosed this statistic, it boasted 100 mln Xbox Live monthly active users (MAUs), which, priced at around $60 per year in the US, is a decent revenue driver for the company. </p><ul><li> <strong>Video games have become increasingly popular</strong>, especially through the pandemic. For example, ATVI's MAUs sat at 316 mln in 3Q19 but jumped 23% yr/yr to 390 mln a year later. Although MAUs were flat yr/yr in ATVI's latest quarter, the company retained its pandemic-related addition in new users, demonstrating this trend's resiliency. </li><li> <strong>Cloud gaming has also been on the rise</strong>. MSFT's Game Pass has added nearly 40% more users since 2Q21, going from 18 mln to over 25 mln as of today. <strong>NVIDIA (NVDA)</strong> has seen an even greater explosion in its cloud gaming service, GeForce Now, which nearly tripled yr/yr in Q3 (Oct) to 14 mln users. </li><li> <strong>Lastly, the metaverse is becoming a heightened focus of many tech companies</strong>, especially game developers and publishers, such as <strong>Unity (U) </strong>and <strong>Roblox (RBLX)</strong>. MSFT stated in late November that it is investing in the metaverse to cement its leadership position in what it believes to be a third phase of the internet. On the call today, MSFT also commented that it is looking to support a robust ecosystem of metaverse content and applications. By bringing on additional titles, MSFT has become an even bigger metaverse play. </li></ul><p><strong>The deal is not without its share of risk</strong>, however. ATVI has dealt with internal strife over the past year; certain higher-ups stepped down as the controversy was made public. Coinciding with these internal struggles, ATVI recently delayed two of its major titles. As a result, 2021 was not a great year for the stock, which recorded a drop of over 30%. That performance did allow MSFT to strike this deal at a bit of a low point for ATVI. </p><p><strong>Bottom line</strong>, although MSFT has made numerous purchases over the years to strengthen its gaming profile, such as its $2.5 bln deal for Minecraft in 2014 and its $7.5 bln purchase of Bethesda earlier this year, this $68.7 bln purchase is by the company's most significant. Given the hefty breakup fee of $3 bln, the deal seems likely to go through and, in the process, to turn MSFT into one of the world's largest gaming companies by revenue. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "d4b3dfce-00f5-44d0-9686-65444cb80eed", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "eee2d2781525b0375b34a506a00321fd39449a81d1b7e0b2a8e9c4c9c9c93c6d", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3647, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "c49a7c36-b4aa-4fdf-832f-c72e8b7a224f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "26094997-4947-49d8-a724-77a15fae23c2": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p><strong>Pure Storage (PSTG +5%)</strong> bounced back in a flash today after it announced a partnership with <strong>Meta (FB) </strong>to provide storage capabilities for the social media giant's AI supercomputer, the Research SuperCluster (RSC), which is planned to be built out by the middle of this year. PSTG checked all the boxes to be FB's likely choice in its development of the RSC, especially given that FB is already a customer of PSTG, and PSTG helped design FB's AI research infrastructure in 2017. PSTG also boasts many other tech giants as customers, including <strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong> and <strong>Microsoft (MSFT)</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>PSTG is a flash-storage array and data management services provider that enables cloud providers, enterprises, and governments to operate their data across most cloud networks, like AWS and Azure.

However, despite the gain today, PSTG shares are still down nearly 30% from all-time highs posted in late December. Even with the stable stream of revenue that comes from its subscription-based services, PSTG is still a high-multiple tech stock, and that space is experiencing uncertainty in a rising interest rate environment. Therefore, although we like the company's expanded partnership with FB, as it shows the strength of PSTG's competitive advantage, the stock, by still trading at over 40x FY22 earnings, could continue to experience selling pressure. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "26094997-4947-49d8-a724-77a15fae23c2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cc6d582ef5395e7f97959024298cbd27fc307bde8e57f7c9275f7da2c3978d97", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2858, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "72b9a771-1df2-43b6-a0b1-01363c7fa108"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a24a198-a0c7-4985-8bd7-9efa0cf4010d": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT 300.57, +12.08, +4.2%)</strong> has \"LinkedIn\" with the market today. After the stock dropped initially following the company's Q2 (Dec) earnings report last night, it was encouraging to see the stock rally off its lows thanks to a positive earnings call and upside revenue guidance for Q3 (Mar). </p><p> We think the stock's initial drop was likely a response to the company's bottom line result. The quarter's EPS beat, while good, was not as gaudy as the beats of recent quarters. Also, many of the product categories in the PBP and IC segments showed yr/yr growth that was lower than their SepQ growth. The most glaring number was probably Azure, which had consistently been growing in the 50% range; its growth dipped to 46% yr/yr in DecQ vs 50% growth in SepQ, 51% growth in JunQ, and 50% growth in MarQ. </p><p> The good news is that MSFT calmed a lot of fears during its largely bullish call, so let's dig into it. </p><ul><li> <strong>Intelligent Cloud (IC) was by far the fastest growing segment</strong>, with revenue up 26% yr/yr to $18.30 bln, at the higher end of guidance of $18.10-18.35 bln. However, as a nitpick, MSFT beat prior guidance in SepQ while DecQ was at the higher end. Also, the 26% growth was not quite as strong as SepQ's 31% growth. Azure's drop to 46% growth, a decent dip relative to recent quarters, is also housed under IC's results. </li><li><strong>On the call, MSFT delivered relief</strong> by reminding investors that Azure can experience quarterly variability, primarily through its per user business. While MSFT did not provide specific guidance for Azure, it did say that Azure revenue growth should be up sequentially in constant currency in MarQ. Unlike <strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong>, which provides a lot of detail for its AWS unit, MSFT does not provide a hard revenue number for Azure. Nevertheless, we liked the directional commentary. </li><li> <strong>The Productivity and Business Processes (PBP) segment fared well also;</strong> revenues grew 19% yr/yr to $15.90 bln. Like in the IC segment, the PBP segment's result was at the high end of guidance following a beat in SepQ. Also, growth slowed a bit to 19% from 22% in SepQ. Most of the PBP categories slowed as well. LinkedIn continued to shine thanks to a strong job market with +37% growth, but it lagged compared to its +42% growth last quarter. </li><li><strong>The star of the show in DecQ was MSFT's More Personal Computing (MPC) segment</strong>, which is not surprising because PCs, Surface, and game consoles are popular holiday gift ideas. Windows OEM revenue jumped 25%, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by a strong PC market, particularly in the Commercial segment, and supported by the launch of Windows 11. Even Surface came through - revs rose 8% yr/yr, a nice bounce back from a -17% decline in SepQ. </li></ul><p><strong>Bottom line</strong>, it looked like the stock was going to be in for a rough day today. The company delivered another great quarter, but the period was maybe not as stellar as recent quarters. However, the call eased a lot of fears, especially with regards to the Azure dip. Also, the upside guidance for MarQ was a big relief for investors. Finally, the January tech sell-off has taken a big bite out of MSFT, which makes us think it's worth a look on this pullback. Its business is quite strong all around.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "6a24a198-a0c7-4985-8bd7-9efa0cf4010d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a529dc7120396e2f73a2100f90f67225352d27c86cb1393dd2f87e621c4eb515", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3462, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "10079b6b-7095-4138-a247-aada9f24f480"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1735f258-306c-4e1c-9eb9-f02452dafab7": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p>After a rough Q4 (Sep), <strong>Apple (AAPL 166.12, +6.90, +4.3%)</strong> bounced back with a nice upside result in Q1 (Dec).

Demand remains robust, but that product faced the most severe component shortages. Services revenue was basically in-line, maybe a slight miss. </li><li><strong>iPhone sales were boosted by the launch of iPhone 13.</strong> Revenue climbed 9% yr/yr to an all-time record of $71.6 bln, despite supply constraints. </li><li> <strong>Mac revenue was the biggest growth category</strong>, up 25% yr/yr to $10.9 bln, also an all-time record, despite supply constraints. Apple is seeing strong demand for its newly redesigned MacBook Pro. Of note, Apple is now one year into its transition to Apple silicon, and already the vast majority of Mac sales are from M1-powered devices. </li><li><strong>iPad was the main trouble area. </strong>Its sales fell 14% yr/yr to $7.25 bln due to significant supply constraints. The good news here is that iPad is by far Apple's smallest category at 6% of total sales; iPhone, meanwhile, accounts for 58% of sales. </li><li><strong>The supply constraints have been long forecast by Apple</strong>, so their impact does not come as a big surprise. Apple warned about component shortages on its earnings call in late July, expecting the constraints to primarily impact iPhone and iPad.

A takeaway here is that even a tech behemoth like Apple is not immune from the global component shortage.

With FB missing EPS estimates and issuing downside 1Q22 revenue, the divergence in its performance versus that of GOOG is quite stark and raises a red flag for <strong>Snap</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>) and <strong>Pinterest</strong> (<strong>PINS</strong>). Those two social media companies, which are slated to report earnings tonight, are facing many of the same issues that undermined FB's Q4 results and outlook, such as:</p><ul><li>The privacy changes to <strong>Apple's</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) iOS are still weighing heavily on FB's advertising business. Ad targeting accuracy diminished significantly because iOS users can now opt out of allowing apps to track their online activities. Consequently, the direct response ads that FB and SNAP rely so heavily on have lost some appeal to marketers.<ul><li>To put this problem into perspective, FB estimates that its reduced ability to provide targeted advertising will cost it $10 bln in revenue this year.</li><li>Following GOOG's upside report, there was hope that the impacts of the iOS modification had lost some potency. That company specifically noted that strength in both brand and direct response advertising fueled YouTube's 25% growth.</li><li>It's clear now, though, that GOOG is taking market share away from social media companies. Unlike FB and SNAP, the company doesn't rely upon third parties to accumulate tracking data since it stores a massive amount of user data in its own data centers.</li></ul></li><li>Perhaps most troubling is FB's admission that it is facing intensifying competition for people's time, particularly from TikTok. This headwind is evident in FB's metrics -- Facebook monthly average users (MAUs) were flat on a sequential basis at 2.91 bln.<ul><li>FB's answer to TikTok's highly popular short-form video platform is Reels, but the company is still working on monetizing that product. Until FB can improve video monetization rates, ad impression pricing will continue to soften.</li></ul></li><li>FB's view regarding the health of the advertising market is vastly different than GOOG's. Recall that GOOG attributed its growth to broad-based strength, with the retail space standing out. In contrast, FB cited global supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and inflationary pressures as key factors that slowed advertising spending.<ul><li>The divergence may be partially explained by the differing makeup of FB's and GOOG's customer bases: namely, FB has high exposure to SMBs that have less of a cushion to deal with rising costs. In difficult times, the marketing budget is often scaled back first.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that FB is taking hits from multiple sides and that relief isn't anticipated in 1Q22. In fact, the company expects the iOS-related headwinds to increase while lapping a period of strong demand from FY20. During this storm, FB continues to hammer away at building out the metaverse, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg contends will be a game-changing technology. However, full functionality of the metaverse may be years away, making it paramount for FB to turn its bread-and-butter advertising business around.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "a0bce29a-d879-4a50-b5ba-0d6d28ad3d1c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "89af5db316c308a65466216bc168c8c2d3df8512252c2a5620046cf1d6edc0f0", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3549, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "57353508-59fc-4c8e-9b3d-74545a6457d8"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "70265ec3-1281-4864-ad10-7490e539bc17": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p>In the aftermath of last week's disappointing 4Q21 earnings report from&nbsp;<strong>Meta Platform's</strong> (<strong>FB</strong>), regulatory concerns faded to the background as the <strong>Apple </strong>(<strong>AAPL</strong>) iOS privacy change and rising competition from Tiktok consumed everyone's attention. Today, however, those regulatory concerns are back in focus after <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that the company may pull Facebook and Instagram from Europe if it's unable to keep transferring user data back to the U.S.<br><br>For some context, in August 2020, the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) issued a preliminary finding, stating that FB's reliance on&nbsp;Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) to transfer data from Europe to the U.S. does not&nbsp;achieve compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Therefore, the commission determined that FB's transfers of data should be suspended. Since then, U.S. and European Union regulators have attempted to restructure a new transatlantic data transfer pact, but a deal has yet to be struck. Without an agreement in place, a final decision on the IDPC's ruling looms, with FB expecting a conclusion to the matter as early as 1H22.<br><br>A negative final decision poses a significant threat for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>Like in the U.S., the data that FB attains from its European subscribers is used for targeted advertising -- the bread and butter of its business. At nearly 25% of FY21 revenue, Europe represents a major market for FB and any significant disruption there would materially impact revenue.<ul><li>For a point of comparison, Europe accounted for 16% of <strong>Snap's </strong>(<strong>SNAP</strong>) revenue in FY21. According to the Business Help Center page of Snap's website, the company is fully compliant with GDPR and UK data protection laws.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>With pressures mounting against FB's Family of Apps segment (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), the company may be compelled to pour even more capital into its metaverse aspirations. While these investments could pay dividends several years down the road, FB's earnings would take an even bigger short-term hit if it accelerates its metaverse timeline.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In our view, FB's threat to completely remove Facebook and Instagram is a tactic to put political pressure on regulators to not disrupt the millions of people and businesses that use its platforms in Europe. It reminds us of the strategy that ride-sharing companies <strong>Uber</strong> (<strong>UBER</strong>) and <strong>Lyft</strong> (<strong>LYFT</strong>) implemented in California, threatening to leave the state if Proposition 22 did not pass. Ultimately, it would be completely shocking if FB followed through on this threat, given how important the European market is to the company. A more likely scenario is that FB settles for a more restrictive data transfer agreement, and/or moves ahead with a new monetization strategy that doesn't rely as heavily on targeted ads.&nbsp;</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "70265ec3-1281-4864-ad10-7490e539bc17", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b107a53a57f4b897624c2026dd07b18a9d3a434464a7bf9300e4059f1aafb855", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3117, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ab2d5791-26e2-4ec5-9427-2af9c9298e19"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "beabda97-1f9b-4edf-b49e-7d7fd8e394bd": {"__data__": {"text": "Morgan Stanley upgraded Taiwan Semi (TSM) to Overweight&#10;Previous rating: Equal-Weight&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-02-07&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "beabda97-1f9b-4edf-b49e-7d7fd8e394bd", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "34adbb38ebdd23e9e69df89cdea186715df39707e80c49e2fe0b619c79d711ce", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 162, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "5ff56572-2b4e-4187-8cbd-bb61a4e99024"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4315300-62a4-40fa-a3d7-127d24d5872c": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p>After <strong>NVIDIA's (NVDA -8%)</strong> main competitor, <strong>Advanced Micro (AMD -3%)</strong>, topped DecQ estimates handily on robust data center growth, the bar was set high for NVDA, which derives over $1 bln more in quarterly data center revs than AMD. As a result, even though NVDA posted a double-digit adjusted EPS beat, robust Q4 (Jan) sales growth, and upbeat Q1 (Apr) guidance, investors expected more, especially given NVDA's lofty 47x FY22 earnings multiple. </p><p>Also, NVDA predicted that non-GAAP gross margins will be around 67% in Q1 (Apr), the same as in the past two quarters, translating to just 80 bps of improvement yr/yr. Those would still be excellent margins, especially compared to the performance of AMD, which boasts around 50% gross margins, and <strong>Intel (INTC)</strong>, whose margins of 55% have contracted steadily over the past year as new technology development ramps. However, that result will not ignite the kind of excitement amongst investors needed to put NVDA shares, which are now down roughly 14% YTD, back on the right track. </p><p> <strong>Still, NVDA had plenty of highlights in Q4 that demonstrate how well-positioned the company is to sustain its current momentum.</strong></p><ul><li>  Starting with NVDA's bottom and top lines in Q4, it beat earnings estimates for the 13th consecutive quarter and grew revs 52.8% yr/yr to $7.64 bln, surpassing the company's prior Q4 guidance and topping consensus. </li><li> Impressively, NVDA's revenue has climbed by over 38% yr/yr each quarter for over two straight years now. This largely results from accelerated demand in data center GPUs, which process complex computations exponentially faster than CPUs. As digitalization has exploded since the start of the pandemic, more and more companies are searching for data insights, building models, and performing other compute-intensive workloads. </li><li> This has paved the way for NVDA to become the leader in supplying GPUs for data center use, as highlighted by the division's 71% jump yr/yr and its 11% increase sequentially in Q4 to $3.26 bln. To put the demand for data center GPUs into perspective, INTC, the leader in supplying CPUs for data center use, grew that segment's sales by just 20% yr/yr in DecQ, despite lapping growth of just 11% in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, NVDA lapped a 97% growth rate from the year-ago period. </li><li>Other segments also grew nicely in the quarter. Gaming revs showed solid growth of 37% yr/yr to $3.42 bln, driven by ongoing demand for NVDA's RTX GPU line. Pro Visualization continued to produce huge numbers, with revs up 109% yr/yr to $643 mln. <ul><li> However, Automotive was the laggard in Q4, as revs dropped by 14% yr/yr and 7% sequentially. After the leading steel supplier for the auto industry, <strong>Cleveland Cliffs (CLF)</strong>, missed EPS estimates last week due to ongoing chip shortages, it was all but certain that NVDA's automotive segment would underperform. However, we do not think this is affecting stock price much today, as it is well understood that the automotive industry is continuing to face supply chain pressures. </li></ul></li><li>Looking ahead, NVDA's outlook is quite bullish. The company expects AprQ revs of $7.93-8.26 bln, translating to 43% growth yr/yr at the midpoint and resembling AMD's MarQ guidance. NVDA also expects accelerated growth in Data Center and Gaming revs sequentially in Q1.</li></ul><p> <strong>Bottom line, although it is not showing up in the stock price today, NVDA put up excellent numbers in Q4</strong>, driven by continued momentum in its Data Center and Gaming businesses.", "doc_id": "f4315300-62a4-40fa-a3d7-127d24d5872c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d0279250ad078511e9fb32a1b407ee9e8189c513ce4664de7813467d34c6248a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3663, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "751ef6ef-2a20-424e-a6bd-83c2a850c64f", "3": "f210f442-ac56-453a-9711-d5cf66ebd589"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f210f442-ac56-453a-9711-d5cf66ebd589": {"__data__": {"text": "driven by continued momentum in its Data Center and Gaming businesses. <strong>However, we think investors just expected more</strong>, especially given the current environment of rising interest rates, which puts heightened pressure on companies that trade with rich valuations, like NVDA, to outperform.

In a turn of events, <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<strong>MSFT</strong>) recently walked away from making a deal to purchase MNDT, opening the door for <strong>Google</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) to swoop in and acquire the company for $23/share in cash, or a total of $5.4 bln.<br aria-hidden=\"true\"><br aria-hidden=\"true\">After <em>Bloomberg</em> reported on February 8 that MSFT was considering making a bid, shares of MDNT rocketed higher, gaining nearly 50% as of yesterday's close. In other words, most of the buyout premium was already priced into the stock prior to GOOG's offer.<br aria-hidden=\"true\"><br aria-hidden=\"true\">For MNDT, the transaction caps off a year of transformation in which the company changed its name from FireEye and sold off its FireEye assets for $1.2 bln last June. By shedding the network, email, endpoint, and cloud security products, MNDT freed itself to focus on cyber-incident response and cybersecurity testing through its Advantage platform. The company had stretched itself too thin in a hyper-competitive market, leading it to post sub-par single-digit revenue growth throughout most of its recent history. <br aria-hidden=\"true\"><br aria-hidden=\"true\">As a streamlined company, MNDT became a more attractive acquisition target, especially in this current geopolitical climate in which cyber-attacks and threats continue to intensify. At nearly 10x estimated FY22 revenue, the price that GOOG is paying is somewhat steep for an unprofitable company, but the addition of MNDT looks like a good fit for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>At closing, MNDT will merge into Google Cloud, significantly bolstering GOOG's cybersecurity capabilities. Consequently, Google Cloud should compete more effectively against <strong>Amazon</strong> (<strong>AMZN</strong>) and MSFT, potentially creating opportunities to gain market share.<ul><li>While Google Cloud has grown rapidly -- Q4 revenue jumped by 45% to $5.5 bln -- GOOG has struggled to make much headway against its rivals. MSFT and AMZN still retain sizable double-digit leads over GOOG in terms of cloud market share.</li></ul></li><li>Expanding its cloud business will help diversify its revenue stream away from advertising. The e-commerce push resulting from the pandemic, followed by the reopening of economies, fueled strong demand for digital advertising.<ul><li>However, if the global economy sours, the tables would turn on GOOG due to its heavy reliance on advertising revenue (~80% of total). A more balanced mix between advertising and cloud would remove some volatility in GOOG's results.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Interestingly, other leading cybersecurity stocks such as <strong>CrowdStrike</strong> (<strong>CRWD</strong>), <strong>SentinelOne</strong> (<strong>S</strong>), <strong>Rapid7</strong> (<strong>RPD</strong>), and <strong>Fortinet</strong> (<strong>FTNT</strong>) are trading lower following the acquisition news.

While the probes are separate from each other, the agencies plan to work together to determine whether FB and GOOG conspired to limit competition on GOOG's Open Bidding platform.</p><p>Here are the key takeaways from this development:</p><ul><li>At the heart of the matter is a 2018 agreement between GOOG and FB that was code-named \"Jedi Blue.\"&nbsp;Of concern is whether this pact -- which FB and GOOG say was publicly known -- led to the exclusion or restriction of competing ad tech services. <ul><li>More specifically, investigators are focusing on Audience Network's participation in GOOG's Open Bidding platform. Owned and operated by FB, Audience Network allows advertisers to promote products and services beyond the Facebook platform, creating revenue opportunities for outside publishers. </li></ul></li><li>According to Margrethe Vestagar, Executive Vice President of the European Commission, the agreement between GOOG and FB may have resulted in the weakening and exclusion of a competing service to Open Bidding. In particular, the allegation attests that the two companies prevented the uptake of header bidding services, which allow publishers to compare bids from multiple advertisers at the same time.</li><li>This is not the first time that this Jedi Blue agreement has caught investigators' attention.

However, if either company is ultimately found guilty of breaking antitrust laws, the consequences could be significant. A negative finding from the EU investigations alone could cost up to 10% of the companies' global revenues.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In the meantime, this development adds just one more overhang to an ever-increasing list for FB. About one month ago, <em>Bloomberg </em>reported that FB may pull Facebook and Instagram from Europe if it's unable to keep transferring user data back to the U.S. FB later refuted that story, but the article highlighted a major risk emanating from the Irish Data Protection Commission's preliminary finding that the transfers of data should be suspended.

FB is simply in a more vulnerable position, while GOOG has displayed resilience and strength over the past several quarters, making it more equipped to absorb a negative headline.&nbsp;</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "acf04b17-b93c-45f8-95e5-931dfaa4daf8", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c7635182f75aaacadc6a981f5190d14f19368816c006f6df18a863e4fe1503d7", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3367, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "27b33e1c-5129-4320-9dd1-057bfc1a290f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9c56504-0dd1-4209-9454-cfc7725ce364": {"__data__": {"text": "Deutsche Bank initiated Meta Platforms (FB) coverage with Buy rating and price target $265&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-03-11&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "f9c56504-0dd1-4209-9454-cfc7725ce364", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cc7ef7ebd76160796623ca589aaf18f9d42710680c530eddd281a1f008edfd26", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 163, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "625f1bc9-ff6c-4564-913d-5c326bdb95e1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "80c0f4b2-4528-4c06-9d96-c844e2664fa1": {"__data__": {"text": "Cowen reiterated NVIDIA (NVDA) coverage with Outperform rating and price target $350&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-03-15&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "80c0f4b2-4528-4c06-9d96-c844e2664fa1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9cc598a3410c41583be66fc0d805e7519a3a65d4973fe2dc6679979cb7a64b40", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 157, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "36ed4056-23aa-455d-9382-2cf888847fc3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "55d14dd3-876e-433f-bb69-c1d6cc2f3e62": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p>Shares of <strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong> are holding up today despite a report by <em>Nikkei </em> indicating that the company is looking to reduce the production of its iPhone SE by two to three million units. The entry-level iPhone was launched on March 18 in numerous countries, including the US, the UK, India, and China. Additionally, AAPL is reportedly cutting AirPods production by over 10 mln units for the year. The reports cites that AAPL is slashing production due to softening demand, driven partly by souring consumer sentiment due to inflationary uncertainties. </p><p>AAPL does not split out sales for iPhone models in its quarterly financial results, instead just grouping totals for all models under iPhone revenue. However, cutting two to three million units is not massive relative to the over 80 mln total iPhones shipped in Q1 (Dec). Therefore, even though the SE picks up many sales in emerging markets, as its price point fits more competitively in those regions, the reduced production is not a massive loss. At the same time, trimming AirPods production by 10 mln units may also not come as a significant loss. In FY21, it is estimated that AAPL sold over 75 mln AirPods. </p><p>However, the reported reasoning is more concerning, as inflationary pressures could take a bite out of sales this year. </p><ul><li>AAPL's new product iterations tend to be relatively minor each year, which may not spur as much upgrade demand as the company anticipates if inflation remains at the top of consumers' minds. For example, the latest model of the iPhone, the company's highest revenue-generating product by far at $71.6 bln last quarter (~58% of total sales), essentially only received a slight bump in its processor, incrementally better cameras, and a brighter screen relative to the previous generation. </li><li> Entry-level products may not be AAPL's top sellers, but they play an important role in attracting new customers into its ecosystem. Although the production cut is slim given the scope of AAPL's overall units shipped, it could still lead to fewer sales for other products, such as iPads and Macs. </li><li>Speaking of which, one of the trouble areas in Q1 was iPad sales; iPad was the only category outside Services that missed estimates. AAPL noted that supply constraints contributed to the slower-than-expected sales growth. Even though supply is set to pick up throughout the year, an iPad is considered a more discretionary purchase than is an iPhone or a Mac, as it performs only some functions of each, making it not as essential as a phone or computer. As a result, its sales may be further impacted by inflationary pressures. </li></ul><p> Overall, investors are not overreacting to today's reports of iPhone SE and AirPods production cuts. We do not think that selling fewer iPhone SEs and AirPods will significantly impact sales in the coming quarters. However, a shift in consumer sentiment away from upgrading electronics due to rampant price inflation would present a more dire situation. Still, phone carriers' subsidies for upgrades and the sheer magnitude of AAPL's global footprint should provide a cushion against a potential inflation-driven slowdown in demand. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "55d14dd3-876e-433f-bb69-c1d6cc2f3e62", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f7382413427e2c42c4f5a864aa57f6eea96a4fdba5de9929f51fa8349f572f17", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3286, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "a54e2c10-45ea-46f4-a368-0d4067fd92e1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7366e18d-1698-432d-8b32-581ff2d3e75f": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p><strong>Meta Platforms'</strong> (<strong>FB</strong>) transformation into a pioneering metaverse developer has been anything but smooth, and quantifying any tangible progress in its efforts has been difficult. Last night, though, a key component of FB's metaverse ambitions was revealed when the <em>Financial Times</em><strong> </strong>reported that the company is developing virtual coins and creator coins. Unlike cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ethereum, these coins probably won't be backed by blockchain technology and will likely be used exclusively within the FB metaverse. In other words, FB would be taking a page out of <strong>Roblox's</strong> (<strong>RBLX</strong>) playbook, which generates revenue by selling \"Robux\" to its users.<br aria-hidden=\"true\"><br aria-hidden=\"true\">Although RBLX is currently struggling through a rough patch -- as evidenced by the 65% plunge that the stock has taken since last December -- it has an impressive track record of growth. Despite lapping a pandemic-fueled FY20 in which bookings surged by 171%, bookings still jumped by 45% in FY21 to $2.73 bln. Profitability has remained elusive for RBLX, but its main priority at this point hinges on expanding its user base and improving its platform. Overall, RBLX's success and popularity is an encouraging sign for FB.<br aria-hidden=\"true\"><br aria-hidden=\"true\">However, the path ahead will remain bumpy for a variety of reasons.</p><ul><li>For all the attention that FB's metaverse plans receive, the company will heavily rely on its Family of Apps (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger) business for the foreseeable future. Advertising on these platforms accounts for 97% of total revenue, which amounted to nearly $118 bln in FY21. Any material shift in FB's revenue mix could take years to play out.<ul><li>Therefore, the well-documented headwinds that are impacting FB, including <strong>Apple's</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) iOS changes and rising competition from TikTok and <strong>Snap</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>), are likely to remain an issue throughout FY22.</li></ul></li><li>Simultaneously, FB is sinking billions worth of capital into data centers, AI, network infrastructure, and a workforce to support the buildout of the metaverse. This year alone, the company is planning on capital expenditures of $19-32 bln, creating further pressure on profitability.</li><li>Regulatory risks continue to build, as evidenced by the recent announcement of a new joint investigation by the European Commission and the U.K. Competition Market Authority. The agencies are looking into possible antitrust activity between FB and <strong>Google</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) related to an agreement the companies made that may have limited competition on GOOG's Open Bidding platform.</li><li>As FB navigates through this gauntlet of challenges, positive happenings like today's news should help improve sentiment. For instance, the company may soon announce the integration of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Facebook, allowing users to post, share, and mint NFTs.<ul><li>CEO Mark Zuckerberg also stated during the Q4 earnings conference call that a new version of the Horizon software will be launched this year. This will extend the metaverse beyond virtual reality hardware, such as FB's Quest 2 set, making experiences and worlds available on the Facebook and Instagram apps.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Receiving some clarity on FB's monetization plans for the metaverse is a welcome development. Following in the footsteps of RBLX by using centrally controlled virtual coins also seems like the most logical, straight-forward avenue that FB can take. While the longer-term vision is becoming a bit clearer, FB is still facing a few obstacles in its core advertising business that could continue to weigh on its results throughout the year.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "7366e18d-1698-432d-8b32-581ff2d3e75f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "216ef2a7ec29f544ccc20a3e8fea1bc4230a98e24ac980d69c8e626903c72f4b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3918, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "b44531ac-ab4d-4516-adaf-6f7554f6d4f7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e76e5c03-1dc5-4a71-82cb-1cdd182ece32": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p><strong>Taiwan Semi </strong>(<strong>TSM</strong>), the world's largest contract manufacturer of chips, continued to experience very healthy demand in Q1 as revenue jumped by 35.5% to NT$491.08 bln, easily beating analysts' expectations. The company, which reported the top-line results in an SEC filing, didn't provide any color on the specific catalysts that drove the impressive growth. However, if we rewind to March 30 when <em>Nikkei Asia</em> published an article on TSM and the health of its end markets, we can surmise where the strength originated.<br><br>Specifically, the article quoted TSM Chairman Mark Liu, who stated, \"Despite the slowdown in some areas, we still see robust demand in automotive applications and high-performance computing as well as internet of things-related devices.\" The slowdown in some areas that Liu alluded to includes smartphones, PCs, and TVs, especially in China.<br><br>For TSM customers with an increasing presence in the auto industry, such as <strong>Broadcom</strong> (<strong>AVGO</strong>), <strong>Marvell</strong> (<strong>MRVL</strong>), and <strong>NVIDIA</strong> (<strong>NVDA</strong>), TSM's strong report is a bullish data point for when they report earnings in late May and early June. Yet, each of these stocks, along with TSM, has failed to gain any upward traction today.&nbsp;<br><br>There are a few possible explanations for the weakness.</p><ul><li>Technology is a lagging sector today as interest rates continue to push higher. High growth companies that have benefitted the most from low rates, such as those in the semiconductor industry, are under pressure as earnings expectations come down.&nbsp;</li><li>Supply chain woes are not materially improving. In fact, they seem to be worsening as COVID cases continue to rise across China, causing more factories to halt production. Accordingly, TSM and other chip companies will likely face even higher costs, while meeting demand becomes increasingly difficult.</li><li>The end result of the two points above is that inflation on the consumer level could reach new heights, potentially dampening demand for products like smartphones, PCs, and automobiles. On that note, U.S. auto sales in March tumbled by over 25% yr/yr due to inventory shortages and much higher prices.&nbsp;<em>Nikkei Asia</em> also&nbsp;recently reported that AAPL cut orders for its iPhone SE by up to 3 mln units.&nbsp;</li><li>Hong Kong-based semiconductor company <strong>Silicon Motion</strong> (<strong>SIMO</strong>) raised its Q1 guidance this morning, forecasting revenue to come in slightly above its original guidance range of $225-$238 mln. This also appears to be good news, but it's worth noting that this enhanced outlook still falls short of analysts' initial revenue estimates for the quarter.</li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that TSM generated strong growth once again in Q1 as the leading chip maker struggles to keep up with demand. Investors are looking beyond the current quarter, though, to assess how higher interest rates and worsening supply chain dynamics may weigh on earnings growth for the semiconductor industry.&nbsp;</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "e76e5c03-1dc5-4a71-82cb-1cdd182ece32", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "640f2a06b125e72314f2c8da90a58136fa1a1fc34206787de88a99ea93d6aecb", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3213, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "312eeb7d-3827-48d5-9b2b-dd6310ca7a05"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "46589745-48be-46a0-87da-f613c39db7c4": {"__data__": {"text": "Robert W.

While many tech names are trading lower today after reporting earnings (<strong>FFIV, GOOG, JNPR, TXN</strong>), Microsoft is moving higher. Initially, we thought the market might react negatively to the company's modest EPS upside, as Microsoft broke its string of six consecutive double-digit EPS beats. However, bullish comments offered during the earnings call have spurred the stock higher. </p><p>The modest beat was not the only problem that we saw in the report. MSFT reports revenue growth by product, and results were mixed on that basis; some categories grew relative to last quarter while others declined. We had expected to see more consistent improvement. </p><p> <strong>So, why is the stock higher?</strong> </p><ul><li>Revenue growth for Azure, a category we watch closely, came in at just 46% for the second quarter in a row. That is a step down from the 50-51% growth posted in prior quarters. However, Azure was up 49% on a constant currency basis; MSFT faced tough FX headwinds in MarQ. Also, the results were ahead of internal expectations, and MSFT's guidance f for a 2-pt sequential decline (constant currency) in JunQ is a bit better than expected. </li><li>Azure's growth has been robust in terms of its consumption-based business. However, its per-user business growth has been moderating given the huge size of its install base. We think investors have been expecting some moderation to transpire, so the declines are not a huge surprise. Also, Azure can have quarterly variability primarily on the per user side. </li><li>Gaming was a definite bright spot. With its Xbox Series S and X consoles, MSFT has taken share globally for two quarters in a row. Also, MSFT identified itself as the market leader this quarter among next-gen consoles in the US, Canada, UK, and Western Europe. In its consumer business generally, MSFT saw market share gains across PCs, gaming consoles, and its Edge browser. </li><li>In further bullish commentary, during the Q&amp;A, CEO Satya Nadella said that among its customers, MSFT is not seeing businesses looking to their IT budgets or digital transformation projects as the place to implement cuts amid a volatile macro backdrop. He commented that he \"[has] not seen this level of demand for automation technology to improve productivity, because in an inflationary environment, the only deflationary force is software.\" A statement like this can really soothe investors' nerves. </li></ul><p><strong>Overall, this was a solid quarter for Microsoft.</strong> Though the company's headline numbers were not as robust as usual, Azure held up well and gaming was strong.

However, FB soothed those concerns by posting a surprising and sizable EPS beat, despite missing on the top line, as revenue grew by a modest 6.5%. The term that best describes FB's performance is \"better-than-feared\", which is good enough to spark a rebound after shares had plunged by nearly 50% year-to-date.<br aria-hidden=\"true\"><br>There's more to today's rally, though, than just some bargain hunting from value-oriented investors. FB's earnings beat signifies a shift in the company's focus toward improved profitability. During yesterday's earnings conference call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg commented that FB is planning to slow the pace of its investments to better align itself with its current growth rates. Accordingly, the company cut its FY22 expense guidance to $87-92 bln from $90-95 bln. Efforts to rein in spending are already evident, as total costs and expenses increased by 31% in Q1 compared to 38% last quarter, when FB missed EPS expectations.<br aria-hidden=\"true\"><br>This renewed attention to the bottom line is music to investors' ears because it shows that FB isn't willing to completely sacrifice earnings potential while it continues to build out the metaverse. As Zuckerberg has frequently acknowledged, it may take years before the metaverse is providing a positive return on investment.<br aria-hidden=\"true\"><br>Other facets of FB's earnings report painted a more mixed picture.</p><ul><li>Facebook daily active users (DAUs) is a key engagement metric that advertisers monitor to assess whether they want to spend more or less on the platform. Last quarter, some panic set in after DAUs showed an unexpected sequential dip to 1.93 bln. Heading into the Q1 print, fears grew that rising competition from TikTok would chip away at DAUs again. To investors' relief, DAUs edged higher to 1.96 bln.<ul><li>The slight bump doesn't resolve the longer-term threat that TikTok poses, though, and FB is fighting an uphill battle in its effort to slow the momentum of the short-format video platform. COO</li><li>Sheryl Sandberg commented last night that the company's progress toward generating significant money from Reels -- FB's short-format video app -- will be a \"multiyear journey\".</li></ul></li><li>All the same headwinds that faced FB last quarter remain in place today, including <strong>Apple's</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) iOS privacy changes. In fact, business conditions are even more challenging now due to the war in Ukraine and Russia's banning of Facebook. The war, along with supply chain issues and inflation, have created a slowdown in eCommerce growth, which is pressuring the digital advertising space.<ul><li>Taking these factors into account, FB issued downside Q2 revenue guidance of $28-30 bln, representing flat yr/yr growth at the mid-point.</li></ul></li></ul><p>FB's Q1 results and outlook certainly weren't exceptional. A skeptic would say that the company simply hurdled a very low bar, setting the stage for today's relief rally. While there is some truth to that, there's more to the story. Specifically, FB's renewed focus on profitability should have analysts ratcheting their FY22 EPS estimates higher. That is good news for a stock that is badly in need of a bullish catalyst.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "4b0818d5-cfb8-49be-9540-b33179b48934", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a9a8a4a978b0d772d19cb1ca5c8f64604ad650b77f78350b7d04589882b6dd75", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3581, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "c29153b8-683d-4f0c-9cdf-4544c2c3ae5b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "aded0691-1c8a-4ba0-b97d-e135e603ab04": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p><strong>Apple (AAPL) </strong>is trading modestly higher after the company reported Q2 (Mar) results last night. The quarter's headline numbers were decent, and the company also announced a 5% increase to its dividend and added $90 bln to its share repurchase program. However, certain cautious comments about Q3 (Jun) are keeping keep a lid on the stock today. </p><ul><li><strong>The headline numbers included solid beats</strong> on EPS and revenue. After missing a couple of quarters ago, Apple has now rebounded with sturdy upside in back-to-back quarters. </li><li><strong>iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Services all performed better</strong> than analyst expectations (see 16:38 InPlay comment for specific comparisons) despite supply constraints. Results for Wearables were maybe a slight miss, but that blemish was minor overall. </li><li> As a standout, iPhone revenue grew 5% yr/yr to $50.57 bln, well ahead of expectations. Analysts had been expecting the category to post a slight decline due to supply constraint concerns and the impact of lapping a tough comparison from the prior-year period. iPhone is by far Apple's largest category (52% of total revs), so its unexpected growth was particularly welcome. </li><li>The Wearables segment, which reported somewhat underwhelming results, has doubled in three years and is nearly the size of a Fortune 100 business in its own right, posting $8.81 bln in MarQ revs. Apple believes that it can pursue substantial growth by attracting customers who are new to Wearables. For example, over two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch are new to the product. </li></ul><p><strong>So, why is the stock not higher? </strong>We view Apple's cautious comments about JunQ as the main problem. Apple did not provide specific guidance, but it expects JunQ to be more severely impacted by supply constraints caused by COVID-related disruptions and industry-wide silicon shortages. Demand remains robust, but disruptions are making it harder to meet customer demand. Apple anticipates that constraints could impact revenue in the $4-8 bln range, which is substantially larger than the MarQ impact. </p><p> <strong>Overall, we are not seeing a lot wrong with the MarQ results. </strong>In fact, we are impressed that the numbers were this good considering the supply constraints. The JunQ comments were troubling, although not entirely unexpected given the COVID lockdowns in China. Investors may have been expecting and pricing in cautious guidance, which may explain why the stock is holding up fairly well in the wake of the company's earnings press.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "aded0691-1c8a-4ba0-b97d-e135e603ab04", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "737eda950e338ea35b678914285b34c7b403beea4a9b41837c6b278e79f3a9bb", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2671, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "589f0314-d6b5-47af-9144-26f9b80d6079"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b4a386c-caf5-4de3-b980-49e442f9ebf2": {"__data__": {"text": "Morgan Stanley resumed NVIDIA (NVDA) coverage with Equal-Weight rating and price target $217&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-05-03&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "4b4a386c-caf5-4de3-b980-49e442f9ebf2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "53299933ab243603568ff8934e0b2f383d4ae42091ac0e900bcbef788cd1bd60", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 165, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "082f6dcb-57e2-4976-8de8-9b494d9fbfad"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "2557cac6-2fb2-449f-8e35-3f1e381f9102": {"__data__": {"text": "Loop Capital reiterated Apple (AAPL) coverage with Buy rating and price target $180&#10;Previous price target: $210&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-05-25&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "2557cac6-2fb2-449f-8e35-3f1e381f9102", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "77eeb92c3b2c1fc4f21d6fe97b3debb0ea2211ab51c27c2154f2b46abbf7b095", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 188, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "71000af4-7b53-4972-ba6d-d0674d1a8c45"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3b68b55-39ff-4cda-9c32-b992aa9a505e": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p>Given that competitor <strong>Advanced Micro (AMD)</strong> had raised the bar earlier this month with its double-digit Q1 EPS beat and bullish Q2 predictions, <strong>NVIDIA's (NVDA +3%)</strong> single-digit earnings upside for Q1 (Apr) and downbeat Q2 (Jul) revenue guidance, announced after the close yesterday, did not initially stir up much enthusiasm. This could be due in part to NVDA's relatively high multiple of 29x forward earnings, a premium compared to AMD at 20x. </p><p> However, with NVDA shares having tumbled over 40% on the year, <strong>its weak points from Q1 may have been priced in.</strong> Furthermore, <strong>NVDA would have exceeded analysts' Q2 revenue expectations</strong> if not for factors outside its control. Also, <strong>the company increased its share repurchase program</strong> to $15 bln through December 2023, signaling that management views the stock as currently undervalued. </p><ul><li>The most glaring negative from NVDA's AprQ earnings report was its bearish quarterly revs guidance, which came in below consensus for the first time since 4Q20 (Jan). NVDA expects JulQ sales of $7.94-8.26 bln, translating to just 24.5% growth yr/yr and marking its slowest quarter of growth in over two years. <ul><li> The lockdowns in China are a culprit, as is demand softness in parts of Europe brought about by the war in Ukraine. NVDA anticipates that those will deal a negative impact of roughly $500 mln to JulQ revs. Drilling deeper, the company anticipates lower sell-through in Russia and China, negatively affecting its JulQ Gaming revs by $400 mln. Meanwhile, foregoing sales to Russia is expected to take a $100 mln bite out of JulQ Data Center revs. </li></ul></li><li>However, one of NVDA's primary suppliers, <strong>Samsung (SSNLF),</strong> cautioned in late April that overall mobile demand was cooling off from the crisis in Ukraine and China's lockdowns. Also, back in late March, another supplier, <strong>Micron (MU)</strong>, noted that production at one of its China facilities took a hit from lockdowns. Therefore, investors may have already suspected that NVDA had a challenging quarter ahead. </li><li> NVDA also demonstrated its technological dominance in Q1, highlighted by its 47% adjusted EPS growth and 46% revenue growth yr/yr. Outside of Automotive, NVDA's segments exhibited strong growth in the quarter, with Data Center and Gaming continuing to set quarterly sales records. <ul><li> Data Center revs grew 83% yr/yr and 15% sequentially to $3.75 bln. Sales from hyperscale and cloud computing customers, like <strong>Microsoft (MSFT)</strong> and <strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong>, more than doubled from last year. NVDA also noted that its customer base is adding capacity to keep pace with demand, boding well for continual Data Center growth going forward. </li><li>Gaming revs jumped 31% yr/yr and 6% sequentially to $3.62 bln, fueled by robust laptop gaming sales. Since AMD and <strong>Intel (INTC)</strong> commented that the PC market decelerated in Q1 from the near-record shipments notched during the height of the pandemic, it was encouraging to see NVDA report strong laptop demand. NVDA supplies graphics chips needed for gaming, helping to sustain its PC demand, as it caters to a different market than AMD and INTC, which provide chips for a much broader audience.</li></ul></li></ul><p> Bottom line, after enduring a brief sell-off to start the trading session today, NVDA is roaring back as the smoke generated by its headline downbeat Q2 guidance clears.

higher today following its fourth consecutive earnings beat in Q2 and upbeat Q3 revenue guidance. As the world's largest contract manufacturer of semiconductors, its solid Q2 numbers set a positive tone for the semiconductor industry ahead of earnings season. </p><ul><li> Alongside a strong earnings beat, TSM also topped revenue expectations, posting 43.5% growth yr/yr to NT$534.14 bln. The sizeable leap in revs was due to broad-based strength, particularly in the three industries that have demonstrated resiliency during the current environment: automotive, high-performance computing (HPC), and internet-of-things (IoT). </li><li> Automotive revs grew 14% yr/yr in the quarter. Although this division accounted for just 5% of overall sales, the double-digit gains are a good sign for automotive manufacturers as well as other chip makers with exposure to the automotive industry, such as <strong>Broadcom (AVGO)</strong>, <strong>Marvell (MRVL)</strong>, and <strong>NVIDIA (NVDA)</strong>. </li><li>Another stand out was HPC sales, which expanded by 13% yr/yr. Like what we saw with MRVL in late May with its 131% yr/yr explosion in data center revs, the data center industry is continuing to boom. TSM's double-digit growth in HPC indicates that this backdrop has not shifted. Therefore, we expect robust data center sales growth for chip makers in the coming weeks. </li><li> Meanwhile, IoT sales also jumped by double-digits, increasing 14% yr/yr. </li><li> On a less positive note, smartphone and consumer electronics sales lagged significantly, growing just 3% and 5%, respectively. However, this should have already been priced in after numerous chip makers began seeing softness in these markets during Q1. Also, MU noticed a similar deceleration in MayQ. This slowdown is something to keep an eye on and whether it will significantly impact PC and chip makers with greater exposure to these markets, like <strong>HP Inc. (HPQ)</strong>, <strong>Dell (DELL)</strong>, and <strong>Advanced Micro (AMD)</strong>. </li></ul><p>With higher interest rates, soaring inflation, and deteriorating consumer sentiment, TSM's Q2 results are a breath of fresh air. They also bode well for the semiconductor industry overall. However, TSM still expects supply to remain tight in 2022, so earnings results in the coming weeks may boil down to an organization's success in navigating supply chain disruptions while facing fierce macroeconomic headwinds. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "4a874f1f-17b0-4c6c-9bc6-8a71fba8c6eb", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e37378c2b58e9a3623684141acfa4c8228489300d641c189aef91ad5a6f1e734", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2586, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "64ae784f-b6df-4db8-8d9b-9512e6d7e6ca"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "036b69c0-be84-4145-9d0b-94b8ad459b7a": {"__data__": {"text": "MKM Partners reiterated Alphabet (GOOG) coverage with Buy rating and price target $140&#10;Previous price target: $165&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-07-18&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "036b69c0-be84-4145-9d0b-94b8ad459b7a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0162b0abd4c5f304f514aa6a74e0d72a49a3a3710924f93724e46d39940af34e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 191, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ed9bfc55-4d43-45b2-b043-9a4a24024e6c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7837582-aa9f-4af2-8fa8-a72e760a8eaa": {"__data__": {"text": "Citigroup reiterated Microsoft (MSFT) coverage with Buy rating and price target $330&#10;Previous price target: $364&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-07-19&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "b7837582-aa9f-4af2-8fa8-a72e760a8eaa", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "3707567aaaf53023e14a9a9f33bc894a019ee4476f23270f9c68221db7619760", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 189, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "551a4ccd-043e-4a29-bf78-7572144194f8"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e01c7ef4-926c-4356-9a1c-f5fc0940df8e": {"__data__": {"text": "Morgan Stanley reiterated Apple (AAPL) coverage with Overweight rating and price target $180&#10;Previous price target: $185&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-07-20&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "e01c7ef4-926c-4356-9a1c-f5fc0940df8e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ac4bbd2efb86849940062a7e161ec87ce29771cd95967485bc4e6152d41b6d1c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 197, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "a98e7705-7216-412c-8c66-f56340a73504"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "50e10464-923c-42b9-8c47-9598036eae35": {"__data__": {"text": "Wells Fargo reiterated Apple (AAPL) coverage with Overweight rating and price target $185&#10;Previous price target: $205&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-07-20&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "50e10464-923c-42b9-8c47-9598036eae35", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7632de364380c8e93b2a12b43331c8b17fa64c04acb216e6386c80d4eff55d9f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 194, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "67c42b13-c1a7-4b3a-bb33-9eec55fa00bf"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "08d3a68d-2840-4902-a68e-303ae4ab3faf": {"__data__": {"text": "Itau BBA initiated Apple (AAPL) coverage with Underperform rating and price target $136&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-07-26&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "08d3a68d-2840-4902-a68e-303ae4ab3faf", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1f4d876c89358d7172e7b27483a147dd6a0456e6298e0123ce51dba13aa549e5", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 160, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "5a7776fd-736b-447f-a875-d4b7a0d17161"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "04757c2f-47c2-4b7a-82ae-f0b6e529efc6": {"__data__": {"text": "Itau BBA initiated Meta Platforms (META) coverage with Market Perform rating and price target $188&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-07-26&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "04757c2f-47c2-4b7a-82ae-f0b6e529efc6", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ebbe759b3c8cdc70b90ab18344c5fc9b25839de4cc087d081287bb12617af85e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 171, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "a0c0401d-36ed-4902-8bea-55aec7a1d37b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c106710-cffc-42f4-85e8-8390bcf4204c": {"__data__": {"text": "Itau BBA initiated Microsoft (MSFT) coverage with Outperform rating and price target $287&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-07-26&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "6c106710-cffc-42f4-85e8-8390bcf4204c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c64bd2995683ff0d2bab9044b4c125f612f6da477789bdeb5ba5fe5d50bb0cc1", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 162, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "6689113d-4a8e-45ce-8546-45a0eda5345d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b71bdfe1-17e6-46a1-ad44-a2b741cd53a9": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p>For the first time in many years, Google parent <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) missed EPS expectations in back-to-back quarters as revenue growth slowed to just 13% in 2Q22. The only time in the past five years that GOOG generated slower growth was in 2Q20, when revenue fell by 1.7% due to the COVID-related economic shutdown. Despite these blemishes, the stock has reacted favorably to a report that can be best described as better-than-feared.<br><br>Unquestionably, <strong>Snap's</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>) gloomy earnings report from last week significantly lowered the bar for GOOG, which slid lower by nearly 10% in the aftermath of those results. However, SNAP's report only served to amplify the existing weakness in GOOG shares. Since early April, GOOG has spiraled lower by over 25%. The main point is that a soft Q2 earnings report was already priced in, setting the stage for a buy-the-dip reaction following the report.<br><br>Drilling down on the actual results, GOOG's performance was mediocre-at-best in Q2.</p><ul><li>While advertising revenue of $56.3 bln modestly beat analysts' estimates, growth slowed appreciably to 12% from 22% last quarter. To be fair, GOOG lapped a very challenging quarter in which advertising revenue surged by 69% in 2Q21. The problem, though, is that advertisers are slowing their spending and that the pullback isn't reversing higher.<ul><li>The segment that's feeling the greatest impact from this decline in ad spending is YouTube. In Q2, YouTube ad revenue increased by a pedestrian 4.8% to $7.34 bln, missing expectations.</li><li>More so than GOOG's traditional search business, YouTube is prone to competitive pressures from short video platform provider TikTok. To answer this competitive threat, GOOG is focused on growing YouTube Shorts, which now has over 30 bln daily views. Monetizing YouTube Shorts is still a work in progress and will take more time to develop.</li></ul></li><li>The deceleration in revenue growth isn't relegated to GOOG's advertising business. Google Cloud posted growth of 36%, representing a material drop off from the mid-40% growth that investors have become accustomed to.<ul><li>This suggests that enterprises are also scaling back a bit on IT investments after a few years of rampant spending. GOOG still expects its Cloud segment to benefit from the digitization of businesses and the need for data analytics and security. Enterprises may be more judicious and tactical with their spending, though, as macroeconomic concerns mount.</li></ul></li><li>Surprisingly, GOOG's expenses grew faster than its revenue, even as the company recently stated that it's slowing its hiring. Operating expenses were up by 24% to $20.1 bln, mainly driven by higher headcount, and increased spending on advertising. As a result, operating margin slipped by 3 percentage points yr/yr to 28%.<ul><li>During the earnings call, CFO Ruth Porat reiterated that the company plans to slow the pace of hiring, so we should see a moderation in operating expenses in 2H22.</li></ul></li><li>A recurring theme this earnings season is that foreign exchange effects are creating a top-line headwind. GOOG is not an exception as the strengthening dollar created a 3.7 percentage point headwind in Q2. Worse yet, the company expects an even larger FX headwind in Q3.</li></ul><p>Financial highlights were few and far between for GOOG in Q2, but its results look much better when stacked up against SNAP's dismal performance.

Initially, we thought the market might react negatively to the Q4 (Jun) report, but the stock has held up nicely and actually popped higher during the call last night thanks to some decently bullish guidance for Q1 (Sep). </p><p> <strong>So, why the big miss?</strong> </p><ul><li> <strong>FX had a big impact on results</strong> as the US dollar strengthened more quickly than expected. That clipped JunQ revenue and EPS by $595 mln and $0.04, respectively, beyond prior guidance. Recall that, on June 2, MSFT provided a rare intra-quarter update. It lowered guidance almost entirely caused by FX. And it turns out June saw a further strengthening in the dollar. If you back that out, MSFT almost reported in-line. </li><li><strong>Another headwind was extended production shutdowns </strong>in China that continued through May. Also, a deteriorating PC market in June impacted Windows OEM revenue by more than $300 mln. Also, clients have pulled back on ad spending, which hurt results at LinkedIn as well its search and news advertising segment. Another issue was that MSFT significantly scaled down operations in Russia, which were fairly large and led to an asset impairment charge. On this last point, it is frustrating that MSFT does not provide an adjusted EPS number. Things like an impairment charge should get backed out. It distorts the comparison to consensus. </li><li><strong>Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 40%.</strong> That is below the last few quarters, but only a point lower than internal expectations, driven by a slight moderation in Azure consumption growth. It is not surprising to see some moderation in growth as this segment gets larger. Also, MSFT says it is seeing larger and longer-term commitments for Azure and it won a record number of $100+ mln and $1+ bln deals this quarter. </li></ul><p><strong>Our overall thought here is that investors are giving a pass to MSFT</strong> for the miss because a lot of it was out of its control. MSFT faced severe FX headwinds with the rapid rise in the US dollar. The overall guidance was actually a bit below consensus. However, again, a lot of that shortfall appears to be FX-related. Based on the stock reaction, the guidance was actually a bright spot. Bigger downside guidance was certainly possible. </p><p> Finally, the stock has been in steady decline in 2022, which makes us think a lot of the negative items from this report were priced in already: FX headwinds, China shutdowns, PC weakness, Azure slowing a bit, reduced ad spend (see <strong>SNAP's</strong> recent report) etc. We think investors are looking past these items and are pretty pleased with the guidance. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "b78c6383-15e4-4396-bf30-5c60bb43561e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f0e406132a30a8b47a2a00c2e23384174f822f2d9b317a804e6a399b5321bf42", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2855, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "414ba552-54a3-4a40-8bb9-ab475a58e435"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a205737-bd9c-45b3-8b2b-38318cf752d0": {"__data__": {"text": "Deutsche Bank reiterated Microsoft (MSFT) coverage with Buy rating and price target $330&#10;Previous price target: $350&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-07-27&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "9a205737-bd9c-45b3-8b2b-38318cf752d0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "317ef49b1fccf58a9034388f6610df464b0299c728812e7bd9d54fdd20815dcc", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 193, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "5577b898-284d-4830-9e61-cc77628f31d0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "63f6e7d5-a8f3-4ee6-866b-cbaae3f42033": {"__data__": {"text": "Stifel reiterated Microsoft (MSFT) coverage with Buy rating and price target $300&#10;Previous price target: $320&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-07-27&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "63f6e7d5-a8f3-4ee6-866b-cbaae3f42033", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "67e785e5deaa8501bbd8f369c8a83f45f884d96b6906415c64eaa2ada53b37af", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 186, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "8360c07d-5f9c-42eb-9004-3c99e901168d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "267e4148-bfc8-45df-9c2f-a432472838bb": {"__data__": {"text": "Citigroup reiterated Microsoft (MSFT) coverage with Buy rating and price target $300&#10;Previous price target: $330&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-07-27&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "267e4148-bfc8-45df-9c2f-a432472838bb", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0f16d45f7655546c1391ee0a89b50370542ca35a56080ddeeb5fcee15250ba92", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 189, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "8650e19a-4c9e-4fe8-aaee-45965a000281"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "18304c32-9517-49ab-abb1-1ca5ecb2df01": {"__data__": {"text": "BMO Capital Markets reiterated Microsoft (MSFT) coverage with Outperform rating and price target $320&#10;Previous price target: $305&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-07-27&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "18304c32-9517-49ab-abb1-1ca5ecb2df01", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "8cac79c0e846f2cd022559a198ebe48f26d9af01d14a610f2367b7f89e592d82", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 206, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "6da1dbd6-74d6-4f42-916b-f97ebd374632"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7514ce5e-e397-4d46-9673-328edea7ddf5": {"__data__": {"text": "Wedbush reiterated Microsoft (MSFT) coverage with Outperform rating and price target $320&#10;Previous price target: $340&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-07-27&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "7514ce5e-e397-4d46-9673-328edea7ddf5", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "91b21af681cf64f90a340bf22933b0db45c51e5e33faad124944b38e311937cc", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 194, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "72f8e5e2-d15b-4fb7-bcdf-48960893da86"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d2f82da-0f58-4c62-8c59-5cda4877be2c": {"__data__": {"text": "Cowen reiterated Microsoft (MSFT) coverage with Outperform rating and price target $320&#10;Previous price target: $330&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-07-27&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "9d2f82da-0f58-4c62-8c59-5cda4877be2c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ba0b0a60daebfa4b94841b8705bd42afb5ddfd2eef5a3bcc976a600deed58cc7", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 192, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "cb89db6a-6df8-48c0-a09a-73bf1fc1d1e5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "43d1936d-ccfc-47e4-a83d-062752179074": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p><strong>Apple (AAPL +2%)</strong> is trading nicely higher after reporting Q3 (Jun) results last night. </p><ul><li> <strong>The headline numbers of a nice EPS beat and in-line revs were quite good,</strong> especially in light of FX headwinds.

Apple cited supply constraints and FX headwinds for these categories not performing quite as well as expected. </li><li>Looking ahead to SepQ, Apple chose not to provide revenue guidance, which was a bit of a letdown. However, it did say it expects yr/yr revenue growth will accelerate during SepQ relative to JunQ. More importantly, it expects supply constraints to be lower in SepQ than what it experienced during JunQ. However, gross margin guidance of 41.5-42.5% is a bit below the 43.2% achieved in JunQ. </li></ul><p><strong>The key takeaway from this report</strong> is that the JunQ supply chain constraints turned out to be less of an issue than the pessimistic view Apple presented on its last call. And SepQ should be even better than JunQ. This is a huge relief for investors as Apple's commentary on the last call was about as bearish we have ever heard them on supply chain issues. The other standout in this report was robust iPhone sales, and that is despite the fact that Apple is likely to launch iPhone 14 in just a few months. Overall, Apple does what it does. It handled a tough supply situation quite well and reminded investors why it is such a great company that cannot be held down for long.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "43d1936d-ccfc-47e4-a83d-062752179074", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ab127f6b4f37351fbc79731ff73b341a6b8538f5cdf7df7555b3edb3495b9d44", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2345, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "b8a503e7-2160-480b-ac5b-66fd0d249415"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9061eed-1937-4192-adfd-ea5f5cdafe95": {"__data__": {"text": "DZ Bank downgraded Meta Platforms (META) to Sell rating with price target $140&#10;Previous rating: Hold&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-07-29&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "a9061eed-1937-4192-adfd-ea5f5cdafe95", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "817af90702ae21f28c7368d60a046d0571b1cca128d4d842ff92558ba1e6886b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 177, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "9845dd23-85ca-4c20-9654-1fcabfd60d10"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "27958896-1373-4ea3-87a6-fc51c57994f2": {"__data__": {"text": "Craig Hallum downgraded NVIDIA (NVDA) to Hold rating with price target $180&#10;Previous rating: Buy&#10;Previous price target: $210&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-08-08&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "27958896-1373-4ea3-87a6-fc51c57994f2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e938d1fc6c6c9d5e15fa3aeffd7e3241e446cde3677bf56dcf02f6c710548b32", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 205, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "1121c0cd-e403-4da2-93fd-dae191f88516"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "913f6f9e-f588-4ebc-84d6-96951ad86195": {"__data__": {"text": "Guggenheim initiated Microsoft (MSFT) coverage with Neutral rating and price target $292&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-08-12&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "913f6f9e-f588-4ebc-84d6-96951ad86195", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c6c4b366a60f723645cb377c19c10aabfc8855fe965c2896fb78022308d76807", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 161, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "c4a1fd39-4457-46e1-9ce5-6ba4b39272bc"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "30a5f050-f0cf-45d6-886c-ee4dbfe85aea": {"__data__": {"text": "Credit Suisse upgraded Apple (AAPL) to Outperform rating with price target $201&#10;Previous rating: Neutral&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-08-17&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "30a5f050-f0cf-45d6-886c-ee4dbfe85aea", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "94bfedbd76a58fdf2ffe9ef1059ddbc669f8fc1d85a206f135b12edbc15f5fea", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 181, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "4f3bea8b-a24d-4053-8bd1-1f9fccffaa39"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "69b404c0-6528-43f9-a983-9227dafea943": {"__data__": {"text": "Morgan Stanley reiterated Meta Platforms (META) coverage with Overweight rating and price target $225&#10;Previous price target: $280&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-08-19&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "69b404c0-6528-43f9-a983-9227dafea943", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4b5c2ec292f864e951133b6a509a6c06580d7322b94e921ba9abc99c0fc8979d", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 206, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "f832c312-6f85-4b48-9bf9-ef137f7b8efa"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9dc28d6c-e45a-435a-962d-9302dfe023a8": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p><strong>NVIDIA's (NVDA +1%)</strong> downbeat Q3 (Oct) revenue guidance ignited a slight sell-the-news reaction to start today's trading session as it made clear the issues from Q2 (Jul), notably weak Gaming and Professional Visualization demand, would persist. Recall that the chipmaker already provided Q2 numbers earlier this month, so all eyes were on its Q3 forecast. NVDA expects Q3 revs to fall yr/yr for the first time since 3Q19, guiding to sales of $5.78-6.02 bln, well below consensus. </p><p>Although Q3 projections were bleak when stacked against estimates, <strong>shares are holding up relatively well today</strong>. We think this is largely due to optimism that the worst of NVDA's issues should shake out by the end of Q3.</p><p>NVDA's strategy is to reduce Gaming sell-in (sales to distributors) over the next couple of quarters to allow channel inventory to correct ahead of the company's next generation of products. Meanwhile, its Hopper architecture, which is NVDA's next-gen platform for data centers, is in full production and the company expects to ship \"substantial\" Hoppers in Q4 (Jan). Also, regarding NVDA's Data Center segment, which hit a snag in Q2 due to a slowdown in China, the company mentioned that this deceleration cannot last indefinitely given the sheer number of people utilizing the cloud. NVDA also commented that its Automotive segment hit an inflection point in Q2, with growth to continue into Q3 and Q4. </p><p>With investors hopeful that most of NVDA's woes are in the rear-view mirror, the company's Q2 numbers are being mainly overlooked. </p><ul><li>As expected, revs grew just 3% yr/yr to $6.7 bln. Gaming weighed on overall sales growth as demand softened considerably, sending revs to tumble 33% yr/yr to $2.04 bln. Along those same lines, Professional Visualization also took a spill, falling 4% to $496 mln. <ul><li> Due to NVDA's reduction in the sell-in over the next couple of quarters, the company expects Gaming revenue to remain a weak point in Q3. This echoes thoughts from rival <strong>Advanced Micro (AMD)</strong>, which predicted a challenging gaming market in Q3, but remains focused on executing its GPU road map. </li><li> NVDA still believes long-term gaming trends remain strong, especially after the pandemic spurred a renewed demand for gaming as a form of entertainment and social connectivity. </li></ul></li><li> Data Center sales jumping 61% yr/yr and 2% sequentially to $3.81 bln was a positive development. However, component shortages and a slowdown of investment from Chinese hyperscalers caused growth to be lighter than NVDA expected. <ul><li> NVDA remains confident that demand is still there, affirming what we heard from <strong>Taiwan Semi (TSM)</strong> last month, which expects high-performance computing (HPC) to be the main engine of its long-term growth. </li><li>Also, even though Q3 revs are expected to fall yr/yr, Data Center sales will see positive mid-single-digit growth sequentially, a minor acceleration from the qtr/qtr growth seen in Q2. </li></ul></li></ul><p> As expected, Q2 was a challenging quarter, and Q3 is not shaping up to be much better. However, today's price movement indicates that the market is not expecting NVDA's troubles to worsen after Q3 and is mostly applauding its strategy to return to growth in subsequent quarters. <strong>We remain bullish on NVDA for the long term and think current price levels offer an attractive entry point</strong>. Nevertheless, with a premium valuation of around 39x forward earnings, shares may undergo some turbulence in the near term.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "9dc28d6c-e45a-435a-962d-9302dfe023a8", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e0b0f6ec8c4091ffd214b79ce6ef89cb26890c8c4bb010c7fe6c414ab2c100fd", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3669, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "524fae51-e3d6-45a9-b932-4e45a70e3122"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "36a745e8-b826-46b8-9645-7ed7c8bcb30d": {"__data__": {"text": "Daiwa Securities downgraded NVIDIA (NVDA) to Neutral rating with price target $133&#10;Previous rating: Outperform&#10;Previous price target: $215&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-09-02&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "36a745e8-b826-46b8-9645-7ed7c8bcb30d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1403240063a5506438756bbfea3fb0df10b324fcb70e07bd3d5e5703b7e9e524", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 219, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "76f6cd36-597d-44bb-b54f-b0d3fcb6a7ea"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c674a98-a42f-4afa-a05c-27adabe86ed8": {"__data__": {"text": "Stifel initiated NVIDIA (NVDA) coverage with Hold rating and price target $165&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-09-08&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "1c674a98-a42f-4afa-a05c-27adabe86ed8", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f48a505ff14d73a96d89199579c3d094484665278cd5ab8eab6aacbbc2913a5e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 151, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "39a9d90d-91fa-4a9f-9feb-21bd479539ba"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7124070e-3246-4cb8-b95a-ef941b9a36b0": {"__data__": {"text": "Daiwa Securities upgraded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) to Buy&#10;Previous rating: Outperform&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-09-14&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "7124070e-3246-4cb8-b95a-ef941b9a36b0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0655701438c51ec960dae91c59c5575203288f8ce5fb0f3f3864116215d30e2b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 178, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ab854ff2-fb24-400e-9fa5-35c881659ea0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f2faea5-5dd3-468f-8672-69e0cfad83fb": {"__data__": {"text": "MoffettNathanson initiated Microsoft (MSFT) coverage with Hold rating and price target $285&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-09-22&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "8f2faea5-5dd3-468f-8672-69e0cfad83fb", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a18c8097ace90963478e16346db28b6582e71475a8346a81e54c89013c73c7a8", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 164, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "7b33fd8e-c50c-49ca-b53d-02538724c203"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "74d7c86c-3acd-47e9-8959-5acb6d9c93a6": {"__data__": {"text": "BofA Securities downgraded Apple (AAPL) to Neutral rating with price target $160&#10;Previous rating: Buy&#10;Previous price target: $185&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-09-29&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "74d7c86c-3acd-47e9-8959-5acb6d9c93a6", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "38d70389e5bc015e195ca7f213956e2296c211fe8e12aaa866732c1fde408f31", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 210, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "282ff2dc-999c-4de5-9364-3f942b5aeaa0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab66e154-7975-4f58-b243-cfa0c0c33338": {"__data__": {"text": "Rosenblatt upgraded Apple (AAPL) to Buy rating with price target $189&#10;Previous rating: Neutral&#10;Previous price target: $160&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-09-29&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "ab66e154-7975-4f58-b243-cfa0c0c33338", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d98d4b8230c973fde61b30d9e1b1c2be919b68d9ac01e2250dcf8d0a2948de7a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 203, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "6db8625b-014c-48f9-8757-cbe443c8de24"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1a57ad8-9a95-4feb-b9aa-36cf732bed54": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p>Coming off a rough Q2 in which <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>META</strong>) missed EPS expectations, experienced its first ever yr/yr decline in revenue, and guided Q3 revenue well below expectations, the company is reportedly implementing a hiring freeze and a workforce restructuring program. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, CEO Mark Zuckerberg held a Q&amp;A session with employees this week, warning that the company will likely be smaller in 2023 compared to 2022, and that it will reduce budgets across most business areas. <br class=\"ContentPasted0\"><br class=\"ContentPasted0\">The news doesn't come as much of a surprise, though. Earlier this month, the<em> Wall Street Journal </em>reported that META is planning to reduce expenses by 10% in the coming months, including through job reductions. Additionally, META signaled during its Q2 earnings conference call that it planned to steadily reduce headcount growth over the next year, with Zuckerberg commenting that the macroeconomic situation \"seems worse than it did a quarter ago.\"<br class=\"ContentPasted0\"><br class=\"ContentPasted0\">There was some hope that conditions were improving, and that advertising demand was picking up a bit when <strong>Snap</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>) issued upside Q3 revenue guidance on August 31. That forecast for 8% yr/yr growth, though, was accompanied by the disclosure that SNAP is also cutting its headcount by 20% in an effort to focus on profitability. Therefore, it was evident that SNAP wasn't anticipating demand to meaningfully recover anytime soon. Recent hiring freezes at <strong>Twitter</strong> (<strong>TWTR</strong>) and <strong>Google</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) further solidify that notion.<br class=\"ContentPasted0\"><br class=\"ContentPasted0\">With META's looming headcount reductions adding to the gloom, it may seem strange that its stock is moving higher today. There are a few explanations for the strength.</p><ul><li>It's well understood that the digital advertising space is suffering a steep downturn. Likewise, META's troubles -- market share losses to TikTok and <strong>Apple's</strong> (AAPL) iOS privacy changes -- are largely baked into the equation, too, as illustrated by the stock's 60% year-to-date plunge.</li><li>Consequently, the focus has swung from META's top-line growth potential to its EPS and cash flow generation potential. Relatedly, cost cutting initiatives are now at the top of many investors' wish lists, and META has recognized that fact. On that note, the company lowered its FY22 expense guidance in both Q1 and Q2. After reducing its expense outlook to $87-$92 bln from $90-$95 bln in Q1, META further trimmed its expense outlook to $85-$88 bln last quarter.</li><li>Prior to this downturn in META's advertising business, there was plenty of skepticism regarding Zuckerberg's ambitious plans to invest billions into the metaverse. That intense focus on the metaverse seemed to come at the expense of META's social media platforms as TikTok and SNAP gained ground. Now, META is forced to re-prioritize its investments on applications that make it more competitive today, such as Reels, rather than on an idea that may never fully pan out.</li></ul><p>It's hard to feel too warm and fuzzy over META's gains today. Clearly, its latest plans to cut costs through hiring freezes and job reductions indicate that business conditions are not improving and may in fact be worsening. For now, though, investors are rewarding the company for trying to stay ahead of the curve and focus on profits as macroeconomic risks mount.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "e1a57ad8-9a95-4feb-b9aa-36cf732bed54", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "59a43a606055787521ba34852a58cbc292dfdf7fc80e41895df56e09e94f3aef", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3663, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "bde8eb3d-c374-4e77-9713-b502dc00ada3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b2a69a5-e331-4f4f-8cd0-c06fe952a1d4": {"__data__": {"text": "Raymond James resumed Microsoft (MSFT) coverage with Outperform rating and price target $300&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-09-30&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "3b2a69a5-e331-4f4f-8cd0-c06fe952a1d4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c2275e6dd0eee07c3006bb80be455d5fe638f0867a04fc3a85f87d376d9fa721", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 165, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "2ffe1b44-4afb-4c1b-a6fc-dc5b4a2a66b2"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "142442f1-8cbf-47b5-9338-2b4e5d2b26a6": {"__data__": {"text": "Barclays reiterated Apple (AAPL) coverage with Equal Weight rating and price target $155&#10;Previous price target: $169&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-10-11&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "142442f1-8cbf-47b5-9338-2b4e5d2b26a6", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0600952a8e66c80a29af8954baa0a944ddae910620cdf32b29d8b712cdc2a666", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 193, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "2e4f8d02-fa23-428b-8eeb-c047adcf45ea"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0679aeed-c3e2-4d3e-9878-16c6371ce60c": {"__data__": {"text": "Credit Suisse reiterated Alphabet (GOOG) coverage with Outperform rating and price target $134&#10;Previous price target: $140&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-10-11&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "0679aeed-c3e2-4d3e-9878-16c6371ce60c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "8f6e2152a53f9a8d87b81f73209ec397b8fc99455e8c009509961c60a9d3f164", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 199, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "5dca433a-0161-4bb5-9992-a6bcfa3c7e54"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "75ca2d00-3ba4-4610-b6b5-d935aacdeecc": {"__data__": {"text": "Atlantic Equities downgraded Meta Platforms (META) to Neutral rating with price target $160&#10;Previous rating: Overweight&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-10-11&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "75ca2d00-3ba4-4610-b6b5-d935aacdeecc", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0da98cbbf6543b1e5ea265dcf2f568ab16bdd596c8dd6eab6f3c4ba37a42a652", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 196, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "d487c9ef-9a31-4307-be6a-57f3a1c31731"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb336182-ae16-44f7-b80c-2b9bf84471af": {"__data__": {"text": "Credit Suisse reiterated Meta Platforms (META) coverage with Outperform rating and price target $174&#10;Previous price target: $214&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-10-11&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "fb336182-ae16-44f7-b80c-2b9bf84471af", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ca3825935479786d5b4b6ac957d217e5ac6c76041f6297fd94f9f58e72e3856e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 205, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "e27e6c53-c548-4793-96df-f813dc0edca3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "91470196-9935-4133-aa48-f0214d0e622c": {"__data__": {"text": "Credit Suisse reiterated Apple (AAPL) coverage with Outperform rating and price target $190&#10;Previous price target: $201&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-10-13&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "91470196-9935-4133-aa48-f0214d0e622c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9ecfc1fb1b40a236c7884358cea4f1386c3bc4082cdab62d39ff7adb20ea7ccd", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 196, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "39631a45-0919-4b2b-84e2-def0c6fcb5d4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e52e3228-0e49-4ae5-beda-79d98ec53674": {"__data__": {"text": "Cowen reiterated Meta Platforms (META) coverage with Outperform rating and price target $205&#10;Previous price target: $250&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-10-13&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "e52e3228-0e49-4ae5-beda-79d98ec53674", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e27d932c72ee90fae2431d987a664491720fa17b810c76fc988e799430345a66", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 197, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "0f38696b-bfc6-4e82-be95-a617bdced189"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c210488-f9da-4c82-841c-913149d58b4a": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p><strong>Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM +5%) </strong>is appreciating nicely today after delivering a solid beat-and-raise in Q3. The semiconductor manufacturer's favorable results follow numerous warnings from competitors and customers over the past couple of months as the semiconductor industry endures considerable demand softness.</p><p> However, that is not to say TSM is not also experiencing weakening demand. TSM stated that it is observing softness in consumer end markets, spurring its customers to adjust their inventory levels, affecting TSM's 1H23 utilization rate. TSM anticipates a few quarters in FY23 to pass until inventory is rebalanced to healthier levels. Also, while data center and automotive markets are holding up decently, TSM sees the possibility of adjustment down the road. These bearish remarks show up somewhat in TSM's Q4 guidance. The company expects revs of $19.9-20.7 bln, representing just 28.9% growth yr/yr at the midpoint, far below the +35.9% jump registered in Q3, +36.6% in Q2, and +36.0 in Q1. </p><p>Nonetheless, TSM's positive comments on long-term demand and ability to outperform the industry during the next few quarters greatly overpowered its less enthusiastic remarks. </p><ul><li> TSM is projecting positive growth for FY23 while maintaining its long-term revenue growth target of +15-20% annualized (in U.S. dollar terms). </li><li> This is partly due to TSM's ability to operate with less volatility than the overall semiconductor industry. Remember that TSM produces over half of the world's semiconductors and nearly all of the more advanced chips. This commanding presence allows TSM to continue winning new business while enabling its customers to win business. It also creates solid end-market diversification. </li><li>It is also worth noting that high-performance computing (HPC) demand remains strong, and TSM is ahead of INTC in technological advancement to capture and maintain market share in this field. </li></ul><p> Still, shares of TSM are down close to 50% on the year, a close resemblance to the overall semiconductor sector, underscoring the difficult environment currently plaguing the company. With smartphone and PC demand falling off a cliff recently, illustrated by <strong>Advanced Micro's (AMD)</strong> over $1 bln cut to its Q3 sales forecast, FY23 will prove quite the hurdle for TSM. The company already tightened FY22 CapEx to around $36 bln from last quarter's expectation of $40-44 bln due partly to capacity optimizations based on the current bearish outlook. It expects further tightening moving forward as well. </p><p>Nevertheless, although TSM is not overly optimistic about the state of its industry over the near term, its reaffirmed long-term guidance highlights that despite industry corrections, it can continue to grow at a high level.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "5c210488-f9da-4c82-841c-913149d58b4a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "aed4607a14051228521eba28d289c8c71a127714137a752d101d09eefe2517cf", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2899, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "7a17c99a-0c71-485d-a633-4909cb4476e0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a4fbe8b-f0de-420b-883e-b8097f36d3c4": {"__data__": {"text": "Morgan Stanley reiterated Microsoft (MSFT) coverage with Overweight rating and price target $325&#10;Previous price target: $354&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-10-14&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "4a4fbe8b-f0de-420b-883e-b8097f36d3c4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "91ca5e09c144507205f46134cb72e673d9d8d97e8551e1645f102043788e5fb2", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 201, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "98ef47f5-b7c7-404e-a1f0-88fea081993b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "246cf6b6-e01f-4b04-8520-7d62c0f6e694": {"__data__": {"text": "Morgan Stanley reiterated Apple (AAPL) coverage with Overweight rating and price target $177&#10;Previous price target: $180&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-10-17&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "246cf6b6-e01f-4b04-8520-7d62c0f6e694", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2a6e2085ab9f12dfb2fb62b7b0450ad56777b6dde1416027293f3e2f5581c5a4", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 197, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "10ae9ed9-19e5-4cc1-ab20-63d673706011"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "17ab49e6-f453-4cb8-92fb-a403d5738c8d": {"__data__": {"text": "BofA Securities downgraded Meta Platforms (META) to Neutral rating with price target $150&#10;Previous rating: Buy&#10;Previous price target: $196&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-10-24&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "17ab49e6-f453-4cb8-92fb-a403d5738c8d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f84aa4b0997b117a9a7df10e186b7a13599593dad574bc0a46affc986606f027", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 219, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "0fe66da6-c853-43e8-b92f-c258551f7b45"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6f29a04-be07-478f-bd38-9831da86b595": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p>For the first time in over five years, <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) has missed quarterly EPS expectations in three consecutive quarters as advertisers continue to scale back on spending.

Recall that the social media company disclosed that advertising revenue growth decelerated further during Q3 due to macroeconomic headwinds, increased competition, and <strong>Apple's</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) privacy changes. On the other hand, GOOG's business has generally held up better than SNAP's and other digital advertising dependent companies like <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>META</strong>) and <strong>Pinterest</strong> (<strong>PINS</strong>).<br class=\"ContentPasted0\"><br class=\"ContentPasted0\">In fact, it can be argued that GOOG's search ad segment has benefitted from the challenges facing social media companies. Search is essentially insulated from AAPL's iOS changes, which has made targeted advertising much more difficult. Therefore, advertisers may view GOOG's dominance in search as a much safer option with a stronger return on investment. Even search, though, has succumbed to the downturn in advertising spending this quarter as revenue grew by a modest 4% to $39.5 bln, missing analysts' expectations.

After a very rare EPS miss in Q4 (Jun), it was nice to see MSFT return to reporting upside again. However, we think the main reasons for the weakness today is Azure coming up a bit light in SepQ and the DecQ guidance was a bit weak. MSFT also made some cautious comments on some other segments during the call. </p><ul><li> <strong>Let's start with Azure, which we think is the main reason for today's weakness. </strong>Azure grew 35% (+42% constant currency, or CC), which was a point below the +43% CC prior guidance and a decline from +46% CC in JunQ. Probably the bigger eye-opener was the DecQ guidance at just +37% CC. The declines have been driven by the continued moderation in Azure consumption growth as MSFT helps customers optimize current workloads, while they prioritize new workloads. </li><li><strong>Recall in our preview, we noted that </strong>the NY Post reported on Monday (see InPlay archive for link) that <strong>Amazon (AMZN) </strong>was freezing hiring in parts of its web services division. That made us nervous about Azure, and especially the guidance for DecQ. And that turned out to be the case. It also makes us nervous for when Amazon reports its AWS segment tomorrow after the close. </li><li><strong>Also, recall in our preview, we expressed concerns about a weakening online ad space </strong>following <strong>SNAP's</strong> disappointing results last week. Last night, MSFT noted reductions in customer advertising spend, which also weakened late in the quarter. That impacted Search and news advertising and LinkedIn. We never like to see a quarter end badly because it likely means the next quarter will be weak as well. And the timing for the weakness is not great, considering that Netflix is launching its first ad-supported subscription plan next month (powered by Microsoft). </li><li><strong>The weakness extends beyond Azure and online ads. </strong>In its consumer business, PC market demand further deteriorated in September, which impacted its Windows OEM and Surface businesses. Also, FX had a big impact on results as the US dollar strengthened. FX decreased total company revenue by 5 points. The silver lining was that the FX impact was generally in-line with the company's expectations. </li></ul><p><strong>Overall, the headline numbers were good for Microsoft,</strong> and a nice bounce back after a rare miss last quarter. However, Azure has been a stellar growth segment for MSFT, but it seems to be slowing a bit. <strong>That DecQ Azure guidance is a pretty big sequential decline (Amazon may report a similar decline for its AWS segment tomorrow, so use caution).</strong> Then when you add in weakness in online ads, PCs and FX, that makes for several headwinds. Also, the stock had been rebounding a bit since mid-October, which tells us sentiment may have been a bit too high heading into this report.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "334674ab-d850-4bba-947e-b8cbe4786080", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c96aa57c097223c642a335e3017850d422724ce44487eaae0e0799c0b7234b62", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3068, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "68679e4b-78fd-415f-a09a-46f4f1497787"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d99c3dd6-5176-4d30-afee-98b79f1be1f9": {"__data__": {"text": "Cowen downgraded Meta Platforms (META) to Market Perform rating with price target $135&#10;Previous rating: Outperform&#10;Previous price target: $205&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-10-27&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "d99c3dd6-5176-4d30-afee-98b79f1be1f9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4848b7e9700f91a30055776a77dff717ced74904e37aedc2e93f993bb502887f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 223, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "4cdea23e-fcea-4a3f-98df-694b758fabc2"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "36fc61c4-6ddf-4b58-bfce-71483b01f6ae": {"__data__": {"text": "KeyBanc Capital Markets downgraded Meta Platforms (META) to Sector Weight&#10;Previous rating: Overweight&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-10-27&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "36fc61c4-6ddf-4b58-bfce-71483b01f6ae", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "605ada0e8dae435379b93c4913ff65c73a8e134ce4f1639932fd636de79dd861", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 178, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "49b2d8b0-6775-4eee-ac02-e87d407f6c66"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba9e1fb9-9363-4960-b0d0-64244ab0fb84": {"__data__": {"text": "Morgan Stanley downgraded Meta Platforms (META) to Equal-Weight rating with price target $105&#10;Previous rating: Overweight&#10;Previous price target: $205&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-10-27&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "ba9e1fb9-9363-4960-b0d0-64244ab0fb84", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "61991f7aa5aba34af0d6eda90514125c5746297d3ea679f80ae5858915ee4c9a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 230, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "32f52629-95e0-4000-94f6-dbf315c88747"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "799d86a2-37e6-4c0b-ad3b-0ef73b985005": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p><strong>Apple (AAPL +4%)</strong> is looking crisp today, recovering from a sell-the-news reaction after the company reported lower-than-expected iPhone sales in Q4 (Sep).

CFO Luca Maestri pointed out that digital advertising and gaming are areas where the company is experiencing softness, reiterating comments made by <strong>Snap (SNAP)</strong>, which is seeing the digital advertising market slow, and <strong>Take-Two (TTWO)</strong>, whose mobile gaming division is facing softness. These headwinds will mainly negatively affect AAPL's Services segment, which it still expects to grow yr/yr in Q1 (Dec), but be impacted by the current economic situation and foreign currency fluctuations. </p><ul><li> Speaking of which, FX impacts clipped over 600 bps off AAPL's revenue growth in Q4.

Although AAPL has been seeing tremendous growth in emerging markets for some time, we like seeing this continue, especially during an economic downturn, as it highlights the company's ability to translate its marketing prowess and brand power to many different customers and cultures. </li><li>Another positive stand out was Mac achieving record revs of $11.5 bln, a 25% increase yr/yr, more than enough to topple estimates. However, much of the improvement yr/yr stemmed from AAPL's supply catching up with demand, satisfying pent-up demand that carried forward from Q3 (Jun). Still, given the steep drop-offs in PC demand lately, it was encouraging to see that consumers still wanted to purchase Macs they could not get during JunQ.</li><li>  The laggard in Q4 was iPad, where revs tumbled 13% yr/yr to $7.2 bln due to FX impacts and an unfavorable comparison from the year-ago period. </li><li>Looking ahead to Q1, AAPL still did not provide detailed estimates, noting that it expects revenue growth to decelerate compared to Q4. A significant component of this is FX impacts, which is expected to take nearly 10 pts off growth. Also, a challenging comparison from the year-ago period is setting up Mac sales to substantially decline yr/yr, which will further weigh on overall growth. Gross margins are expected to expand slightly, with AAPL projecting 42.5-43.5%. </li></ul><p>Bottom line, AAPL's Q4 results highlight the impressive brand loyalty the company has garnered, allowing it to continue delivering solid growth during an environment that has taken a toll on many of its peers. Although Q1 is not shaping up to be an exciting quarter, the situation could have been much worse. Plus, with demand remaining relatively healthy, investors are not overly concerned with the factors weighing on AAPL's near-term results as they are largely outside its control. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "799d86a2-37e6-4c0b-ad3b-0ef73b985005", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "67b9bff668a663f1b4bf3b54e57f0d4cf754bae93998af36faee50ebd326d9eb", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3481, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "c6fb4a89-a3e4-42a8-acc3-76c344a8bc08"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "fcaa25ed-7166-46ec-ac19-b640ab3e795d": {"__data__": {"text": "Wedbush reiterated Apple (AAPL) coverage with Outperform rating and price target $200&#10;Previous price target: $220&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-10-28&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "fcaa25ed-7166-46ec-ac19-b640ab3e795d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "28967fe3b64bcf4a5c5223af1aa819e6d5156f9a05b63b03eeaf65c46f00d2c0", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 190, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "048d1c38-d09f-4223-9697-c049bcbdb9aa"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f4b9ac0-de0e-4065-8ed2-3a7df6bb9497": {"__data__": {"text": "Robert W.

suffering through its most challenging period as a public company, is on the verge of laying off thousands of employees as it looks to slash expenses. According to the <em>Wall Street Journal, </em>which broke this story,<em></em>the broad-based job cuts could come as early as Wednesday. It doesn't come as a surprise that layoffs are coming since META CEO Mark Zuckerberg has signaled a few different times that workforce reductions were under consideration. Most recently, during the 3Q22 earnings conference call, Zuckerberg commented that while some teams within the company will grow meaningfully, others will stay flat or will shrink next year.<br><br>However, Zuckerberg also stated that he anticipated head count at the end of 2023 to be approximately in line with 3Q22 levels. That statement was somewhat surprising and disappointing to investors who were expecting META to significantly lower its cost structure. On that note, META's FY23 operating expense guidance of $96-$101 mln, representing a projected yr/yr increase of 15% at the midpoint, did not go over well and was a primary reason why the stock cratered by about 25% the day after its earnings report.<br><br>Today, though, shares are moving higher on the report as the magnitude of the layoffs come into focus. Over the past couple of months, META has trimmed its workforce in a more targeted way, but the number of job cuts in this round may be more than what many were expecting. In fact, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reported that META's job cuts could be the most of any technology company so far this year. To put that into perspective, <strong>Twitter</strong> (<strong>TWTR</strong>) laid off nearly 3,700 employees last week after Elon Musk took the helm.<br><br>With META expecting its revenue to decline on a yr/yr basis for the third consecutive quarter in Q4, it's evident that the company needs to be right sized and better aligned with an eroding demand landscape. Its troubles, including market share losses to TikTok and privacy changes for <strong>Apple's</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) iOS, are well documented. However, the big picture issues that are plaguing META run even deeper and can't be fully remedied by layoffs.<br><ul><li>As META began to lose ground to TikTok and to other competitors, Zuckerberg set his sights on virtual/augmented reality and the Metaverse. A new segment called Reality Labs was created to house the AR/VR products, while META's social media apps were separated out to the Family of Apps segment.</li><li>Although it's still relatively early in META's transformation process, the results for Reality Labs so far have been quite discouraging. In Q3,&nbsp;Reality Labs' revenue tumbled by nearly 50% to $285 mln, while the operating loss worsened to $(3.7) bln from $(2.6) bln in the year-earlier period.</li><li>META has no plans to let off the accelerator, though, and is forecasting FY23 capex of $96-$101 bln, equating to an estimated yr/yr increase of 12%. A majority of the spending will be poured into the loss-generating Reality Labs segment.</li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that investors are relieved to see that META is taking its cost cutting efforts seriously after the company issued disappointing FY23 operating expense guidance. Serious questions and doubts regarding the company's metaverse aspirations remain, though, and we anticipate that META's financial performance will continue to underwhelm for the foreseeable future.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "08ba8da3-7f6a-4f31-a66c-42e239047f1c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f9259ede3fb91af63914a93aca118f25db7aafb5fab042b42c49218a29543b60", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3607, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "12ad8bae-8a21-4310-8984-f05e5a23f791"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b764a9d-3088-4815-90cb-94448fad563c": {"__data__": {"text": "Itau BBA upgraded Meta Platforms (META) to Outperform rating with price target $102&#10;Previous rating: Market Perform&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-11-07&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "6b764a9d-3088-4815-90cb-94448fad563c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e6f509b302f48edeaad5da7e651e7c478949e4bb63f13235de192a779177d6df", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 192, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "88853997-d202-4aad-aa77-06943b9b8d88"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "03745653-4393-4a91-9293-a43207bc513c": {"__data__": {"text": "Credit Suisse resumed NVIDIA (NVDA) coverage with Outperform rating and price target $210&#10;Previous price target: $205&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-11-16&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "03745653-4393-4a91-9293-a43207bc513c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "108a132513eaadb5a47cbc9d2724bba53b7e841026144b508430890c5e526f77", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 194, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "e74479d7-e652-4905-8e87-1a87b86f43ce"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "2aaa7364-5213-4490-96d0-05d756100bda": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p><strong>NVIDIA's (NVDA) </strong>Q3 (Oct) earnings report contained some positive developments, including what appears to be a bottom in Gaming revenue. However, the chip maker's second-straight earnings miss and light Q4 revenue guidance are keeping shares in check. The broader markets ticking lower is also a factor weighing on the price.</p><ul><li> Investors were likely not expecting robust headline results in Q3 after several chip makers warned of a rapidly deteriorating demand backdrop in the months leading up to NVDA's report. In fact, NVDA already warned that Q3 would be challenging last quarter, expecting sequential declines in its Gaming (~26% of total revs) and Professional Visualization (~3%) segments, as well as a 460 bp contraction in non-GAAP gross margins yr/yr to 62.4% (the midpoint of its prior guidance). </li><li>Although NVDA's Gaming and ProViz predictions materialized, declining 23% and 60% qtr/qtr, respectively, margins dipped further than expected, tumbling 10.9 pts yr/yr to 56.1%. This helped fuel NVDA's double-digit adjusted EPS miss, a blemish that may be clouding out other positives. </li><li>One such positive was revenues falling less than analysts anticipated, dropping 16.5% yr/yr to $5.93 bln. The heavy lifter here was NVDA's Data Center segment (~65%), which delivered 31% growth yr/yr and 1% sequentially. NVDA remarked that growth was broad-based across leading U.S. cloud service providers, consumer internet firms, and other vertical industries. Meanwhile, the weak sequential growth was mainly due to lingering fragility in China. </li><li>NVDA's Q4 revenue guidance of $5.88-6.12 bln slightly missed estimates. However, we think it is better to focus on the silver lining that NVDA expects a sequential improvement in Gaming sales, signaling that the worst of the slowdown in demand may be over. Recall NVDA's strategy last quarter was to reduce sell-in over Q2 (Jul)-Q4 (Jan) to let channel inventories correct. NVDA is still working through the correction, but given the sequential growth forecast, NVDA seems on track to deliver on its Q2 expectation to enter FY23 in good shape.<ul><li>  Margins are also expected to make a good recovery, with NVDA targeting non-GAAP gross margins of 65.5-66.5% in Q4, translating to only a 100 bp contraction yr/yr at the midpoint. </li></ul></li></ul><p> Even though investors do not seem to have much appetite for NVDA shares today, the company's Q3 report was mostly positive. There are still a few lingering concerns, such as softening Gaming and Data Center demand in China, which cropped up toward the end of Q2. China is NVDA's second-largest market in terms of where products are initially billed, comprising around 26% of total revs in FY22 (second to Taiwan at ~32%). Hence, weakness in the region adds a layer of uncertainty. ProViz is also finding it more difficult to recover than Gaming, with NVDA forecasting flattish growth qtr/qtr in Q4. Still, we think NVDA remains a solid long-term play but caution that its relatively pricey ~40x forward earnings multiple, a sizeable premium to <strong>Advanced Micro (AMD)</strong> at ~23x and <strong>Intel (INTC)</strong> at ~20x, could continue to create volatility in the near term. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "2aaa7364-5213-4490-96d0-05d756100bda", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "63683d9f829a446a266afba235e442a4a58516793b5b3e67b18743506028a9dd", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3311, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "dba498d4-ed9b-45a8-bde3-851cf1147045"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f123bf6-3dfa-4b5b-9b8f-bd157ee70f8e": {"__data__": {"text": "Summit Insights upgraded NVIDIA (NVDA) to Buy&#10;Previous rating: Hold&#10;Issuance Date: 2022-11-17&#10;&#10;Copyright 2022 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "1f123bf6-3dfa-4b5b-9b8f-bd157ee70f8e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "fed17283f33a6ae21f20bee9299ccc5153aa90b4d4cde6ee9579cd4fdf17f35a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 144, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "df972427-41ec-4417-bb30-72483bb46bd8"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1443d5ec-ddeb-4970-a09e-d67c3a680deb": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body>Apple's (<strong>AAPL</strong>) losses are taking a bite out of the stock market today as ongoing production issues at Foxconn's manufacturing plant in China continue to impact iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max shipments. According to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), wait times for these higher-end iPhone models have extended to 5-6 weeks, which is two weeks longer than typical wait times seen in October. Coinciding with this news are reports that COVID-19 cases are rising again in China, including in Beijing where Chinese authorities are asking residents to stay home.&nbsp;<br><br>The Foxconn plant, located in Zhengzhou, China, is grappling with high employee turnover due to COVID-19 outbreaks, causing the facility to operate at significantly reduced capacity. However, this is nothing new, so the SCMP article doesn't come as a major surprise. When AAPL reported earnings on October 27, CEO Tim Cook commented that the lower-than-expected Q4 iPhone sales were a result of production issues. Cook added that the supply chain issues could last \"a little while longer.\"<br><br>Then, a couple weeks later, AAPL confirmed that the Foxconn facility was still contending with virus outbreaks. Consequently, AAPL said it was expecting lower iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max shipments than it previously anticipated as wait times get pushed out.<br><br>These production delays are discouraging, but there are a couple important items to keep in mind.<br><ul><li>First and foremost, demand for iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max is strong and last quarter's sales shortfall was completely attributable to production constraints. With these issues continuing, iPhone estimates are coming down again for 1Q23, setting up for a potentially lackluster quarter. However, most of the delayed shipments should be recouped in the seasonally slower Q2 as AAPL's loyal customers wait it out.<ul><li>Additionally, it's worth noting that wait times for iPhone 14 base models haven't changed.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Despite missing analysts' Q4 iPhone estimates, AAPL still beat earnings expectations. The EPS beat was in part fueled by record Q4 gross margin of 42.3%, which came in towards the high end of AAPL's guidance of 41.5-42.5%. A similar scenario could play out in Q1 as higher average selling prices for AAPL's products buoy margins.</li></ul><p>Considering that Foxconn produces as much as 70% of AAPL's iPhones, the persistent capacity constraints there are a significant ordeal. As frustrating as the situation is, though, Foxconn's production issues don't change the fact that demand for iPhone 14 is robust and that most of those delayed shipments will eventually translate to the top-line.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "1443d5ec-ddeb-4970-a09e-d67c3a680deb", "embedding": null, "doc_hash":

The initial pop in the stock was a little surprising because the headline numbers were not super great with a modest EPS beat and a slight miss on revs. But as we said last night, we think investors focused on Azure, which reported slight upside. Unfortunately, the stock headed lower during the call on cautious commentary and downside MarQ revenue guidance. </p><ul><li><strong>Let's start with Azure, </strong>which grew +38% constant currency (CC) in DecQ, a bit better than the +37% CC prior guidance and we would argue better than feared after a miss in SepQ. However, that was still down a good bit from +42% CC in SepQ and +46% CC in JunQ. Probably the bigger eye-opener was the MarQ guidance. MSFT exited DecQ with Azure growth in the mid-30s CC and expects a 4-5 pt decline in MarQ. We do not have a hard number guidance, but that sounds like low 30s CC. </li><li> MSFT expects its per user business for Azure to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, but it expects continued moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. The takeaway here is we did not get the stabilization in Azure we wanted to see, so that's a concern. Also, this is not great news for <strong>Amazon's (AMZN)</strong> AWS unit, which is likely facing similar headwinds. AMZN reports next week (Feb 2). </li><li><strong>Moving beyond Azure,</strong> MSFT was pretty cautious in general. Just as customers accelerated their digital spend during the pandemic, MSFT is now seeing them optimize that spend. Organizations are exercising caution given the macro uncertainty. From a geographic perspective, MSFT noted that the US was weaker than expected. </li><li><strong>In its Consumer business,</strong> the PC market was in line with expectations, but execution challenges impacted Surface results. Ad spend declined slightly more than expected, which impacted Search and news advertising and LinkedIn. </li><li><strong>On the Commercial side,</strong> <strong>customers are exercising caution </strong>and MSFT saw results weaken through December. We never like to see a quarter end on a down note as it usually means the next quarter will be weak. Also, MSFT saw moderated consumption growth in Azure and lower-than-expected growth in new business across the standalone Office 365, EMS and Windows Commercial products that are sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. </li></ul><p> <strong>The big takeaways here</strong> are the weak guidance for MarQ and that Azure's growth moderation has not bottomed out yet, or even stabilized. Given Microsoft's immense size, this is adding to jitters about the economy in 2023 generally and rightly so. <strong>It also makes us nervous for Amazon's Q4 report next week, particularly its AWS unit. </strong>Then when you add in weakness in online ads, Surface, FX and increased caution from enterprise clients, that makes for several headwinds. Like many tech names, MSFT has seen its stock price bounce a bit in 2023, but this report/outlook is putting a damper on the tech space today. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "24fca16a-93df-49c6-b430-d721f9e8e3f2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "396251ac026a20a3e41c1fbbcaf00c17070927d0dceff5ea874860639189dee1", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3257, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "76dd4c5c-74f8-4b58-b4fa-2546de206687"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a26fafe8-9e6d-4468-9c5a-6f53b20cc982": {"__data__": {"text": "BMO Capital Markets downgraded Microsoft (MSFT) to Market Perform rating with price target $265&#10;Previous rating: Outperform&#10;Previous price target: $267&#10;Issuance Date: 2023-01-25&#10;&#10;Copyright 2023 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "a26fafe8-9e6d-4468-9c5a-6f53b20cc982", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7199ebc9ca99bf29f717170151d11a28fe8c3af83466f2d17d9198e098cbb51f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 232, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "f051af5a-89db-4dbd-b4f1-fe51055c13e3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3db63b7-79aa-474e-bff9-5d4f4af9f5f6": {"__data__": {"text": "BofA Securities reiterated Apple (AAPL) coverage with Neutral rating and price target $153&#10;Previous price target: $154&#10;Issuance Date: 2023-01-27&#10;&#10;Copyright 2023 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "f3db63b7-79aa-474e-bff9-5d4f4af9f5f6", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "dc50198a8cb292b3b4929ad36054a56e715a91e034f2f0ec8db7095d5038915a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 195, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "31b39945-0a4c-4a51-85da-06dab44b6d0c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "90f39b33-6e27-486b-9ac5-4203a908d9d1": {"__data__": {"text": "Jefferies reiterated Meta Platforms (META) coverage with Buy rating and price target $175&#10;Previous price target: $155&#10;Issuance Date: 2023-01-30&#10;&#10;Copyright 2023 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "90f39b33-6e27-486b-9ac5-4203a908d9d1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7e8d24eaae15e6237e7cf3865ce799fbea60bebcfa30ed40f26e4e59ac621afd", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 194, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "57cecfdb-e234-44b0-bc5f-e913f33b687f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d5bf50a-e6f3-49b0-be4b-54ef2820e578": {"__data__": {"text": "BofA Securities reiterated Alphabet (GOOG) coverage with Buy rating and price target $119&#10;Previous price target: $116&#10;Issuance Date: 2023-01-31&#10;&#10;Copyright 2023 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "4d5bf50a-e6f3-49b0-be4b-54ef2820e578", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "eefb3392df42034ed64bf08e93927f3739b6559d27eff848071e7f78bbf9eddc", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 194, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "c41e8f79-8c88-450b-bcaf-833d29cfe8aa"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c23fd797-f3a0-4ac0-a0d5-b6c2de08457c": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p>Three months ago, <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>META</strong>) was trading at its lowest levels in about seven years as Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse aspirations and the associated spending spree to support that buildout caused investors to leave the stock in droves. Just as it seemed META completely lost its way by shunning the bread-and-butter social media/digital advertising business that made it a must-own stock, the company began a game-changing pivot last November that has lit a fire under its shares. That pivot to rein in costs, while refocusing on what has made META so successful in the past -- namely, its Family of Apps business -- was on display last night when the company issued its 4Q22 earnings report.</p><ul><li>On November 9, META reaffirmed its Q4 revenue guidance of $30.0-$32.5 bln, but that wasn't the main story. Instead, the focal point rested on META's reduced FY23 operating expense guidance of $94-$100 bln, which was made possible by its simultaneous announcement of a workforce reduction of 11,000 positions. </li><li>It was only two weeks earlier that the stock was pummeled by nearly 25% in the wake of a Q3 earnings miss and a FY23 forecast that called for operating expenses to jump by about 15% to $96-$101 bln. Furthermore, META's capex outlook of $34-$39 bln represented a 12% increase at the midpoint, signaling that Zuckerberg had no intention of scaling back his metaverse investments, even as concerns of a looming recession intensified.</li><li>Following a 64% nosedive for the stock in 2022, the post-Q3 earnings report collapse was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back for Zuckerberg. Suddenly, 2023 is now the \"year of efficiency\", according to Zuckerberg, with the CEO aiming to slash even more costs this year. </li><li>One key catalyst for the stock's meteoric rise today is the further reduction in FY23 total expense guidance to $89-$95 bln, and the reduced capex forecast to $30-$33 bln. Perhaps as important as the capex cut itself is the disclosure that META expects nearly all of its expenditures to support the Family of Apps segment, rather than the loss-generating Reality Labs (metaverse) segment. On that note, Family of Apps posted Q4 operating income of $10.7 bln, compared to an operating loss of ($4.3) for Reality Labs.</li><li>The change of heart from Zuckerberg has ignited a dramatic turnaround. Since the November 9 update, the stock has soared by an incredible 80%, despite the fact that revenue and earnings growth have both evaporated. In Q4, revenue and GAAP EPS fell by 4.5% and 52%, respectively, offering a not-so-subtle reminder that META is still facing numerous challenges.</li><li>A soft digital advertising market is at the top of that list, with competitive pressures from TikTok, and <strong>Apple's</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) iOS changes from last year, also weighing on META's growth. </li><li>However, META's inline revenue guidance of $26.0-$28.5 bln, which reflects a 2.1% yr/yr increase at the high end, shows that it's faring much better than rival <strong>Snap</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>). Recall that on Tuesday night, SNAP noted in its Q4 earnings report that quarter-to-date revenue for 1Q23 was down by about 7%, prompting it to forecast a 2-10% drop for the quarter. It's now evident that SNAP's troubles are amplified by company-specific issues, including its decision to&nbsp;implement some changes to its direct response advertising platform that will be disruptive for its partners.</li><li>The emergence of Reels -- META's answer to TikTok's ultra-popular short-format video platform -- is another encouraging development that's fueling the stock's", "doc_id": "c23fd797-f3a0-4ac0-a0d5-b6c2de08457c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "41af2b61437f94517358fd3e54146402807a86ca55c4a0db8b5f5fc31c8a8573", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3701, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "1129bdb8-a9a2-4353-b403-0fda76d90e2a", "3": "7224e427-fe4e-4496-8074-ad757f156712"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7224e427-fe4e-4496-8074-ad757f156712": {"__data__": {"text": "short-format video platform -- is another encouraging development that's fueling the stock's gains.

Also, the tech giant forecasted Q2 (Mar) sales performance to mirror Q1, translating to another rare yr/yr decline and below analyst projections.</p><p>  In addition to weakening consumer sentiment, AAPL faced other challenges outside its control, including a relatively strong U.S. dollar and supply chain constraints. These headwinds resulted in adjusted earnings slipping by 10.5% yr/yr to $1.88 and revs sinking by 5.5% to $117.15 bln, AAPL's first quarterly decline since 2Q19 (Mar). Additionally, the revenue from iPhones, Macs, and wearables missed analyst estimates in the quarter. </p><p> However, despite the tepid headline results and climbing over 20% to start the year, shares are holding up nicely today, recouping their initial losses. </p><ul><li> A significant factor buoying the stock was that AAPL has more of a supply problem than a demand one, similar to last quarter. iPhone supply could not keep pace with demand in Q1, causing ship times to extend well beyond what AAPL anticipated. </li><li> Also, although iPhone supply was constrained during the quarter, AAPL managed to keep sales from dipping, maintaining relatively flat iPhone revs yr/yr at $65.8 bln. Meanwhile, iPad revenue jumped by over 13% yr/yr to $9.4 bln, crushing the consensus, which called for a single-digit decline. <ul><li>On the flip side, AAPL does not expect iPad to continue seeing growth, forecasting a double-digit decline yr/yr in MarQ. AAPL provided the same outlook for Mac sales. </li></ul></li><li> It was also encouraging to hear CEO Tim Cook comment that production is now back to where it should be, especially after several disruptions in China throughout the past few months sparked heightened uncertainty. As a result, AAPL projects iPhone revs to accelerate sequentially in MarQ. </li><li>Furthermore, if not for foreign exchange impacts, which clipped 800 bps off sales growth in the quarter, AAPL would have seen positive growth yr/yr and posted growth in most of the markets it tracks. The same story will also play out in MarQ, as AAPL projects FX headwinds to dent sales growth by 5 pts. </li><li>AAPL also reached a milestone in the quarter, boasting over two billion active devices as part of its installed base, double the figure from seven years ago. The significance of this achievement is that it represents a sturdy foundation for future ecosystem expansion. </li></ul><p>AAPL tempered expectations heading into Q1, expecting revs to decelerate sequentially and Mac revs to experience a substantial decline due to challenging comps. As a result, although its Q1 report was not exactly crisp, AAPL delivered relatively decent numbers, especially when stacked against the numerous obstacles it had to endure.</p><p>  It is crystal clear by now that 2023 will be a turbulent year for tech firms with heavy consumer exposure. However, it is hard to bet against AAPL and its exceptional brand loyalty, especially when the company continues to demonstrate that demand remains sound.    </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "938dcafe-8c6e-4091-8ea6-6126ec6138ab", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "8b1e574937e706a3907f6ef07e00e4b0a7ab85a22b41b513c7de79e34454bd7c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3259, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ca939f8f-8c60-4e40-91d2-51fa189f43f4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1554c484-9897-4a10-b915-632ec8c210b4": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p>The positive vibes that spilled over from <strong>Meta Platforms'</strong> (<strong>META</strong>) better-than-feared earnings report faded for Google parent <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) after the company posted its fourth consecutive EPS miss last night. GOOG's Q4 earnings shortfall was accompanied by yr/yr revenue decreases of 1.6% and 7.8% in its Search and YouTube businesses, respectively. In fact, excluding the pandemic-impacted quarter of 2Q20, this was the first quarter in GOOG's history that its total advertising revenue declined on a yr/yr basis, dipping by 3.6% to $59.0 bln. While META's results provided some relief, GOOG's results are offering a stark reminder that digital advertising dependent companies  are still fighting an uphill battle as marketers rein in spending.</p><ul><li>Negative foreign exchange effects did make GOOG's performance look a bit worse than it really was. On a constant currency basis, revenue for the bread-and-butter Search and Other segment increased moderately over last year. </li><li>Staying true to recent form, the retail and travel categories exhibited strength, while finance was a laggard. Broadly speaking, though, the company experienced a further pullback in advertiser spend, with CEO Sundar Pichai commenting that the macroeconomic climate has become more challenging.</li><li>Enterprises aren't just becoming more judicious with their marketing investments. A common theme among technology companies is that some of their customers are reducing or delaying IT expenditures, and GOOG isn't immune to this phenomenon. Although Google Cloud generated solid revenue growth of 32%, that's down from 38% last quarter. That lags <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<strong>MSFT</strong>) Azure's Q4 growth of 38%, but it's well ahead of the 20% growth achieved by <strong>Amazon</strong> (<strong>AMZN</strong>) Web Services. What's concerning, though, is that MSFT guided for a 4-5% decline for Azure in 1Q23, indicating that enterprise IT spending has weakened further.</li><li>The good news is that Google Cloud's operating losses are now shrinking. After narrowing to ($699) mln from ($858) mln last quarter, Cloud's operating loss improved to ($480) mln in Q4. During the earnings call, both Mr. Pichai and CFO Ruth Porat stated that the company remains \"very focused on Google Cloud's path to profitability.\"</li><li>That sharpened focus on profitability extends to the rest of the company. GOOG is reengineering its entire cost structure as it slows the pace of its operating expense growth. On January 20, GOOG ramped up its cost-cutting efforts when it announced a workforce reduction of 12,000 roles, but its plan doesn't end there. </li><li>In 2023, the pace of hiring will slow considerably, while at the same time, the use of AI and automation is expected to improve productivity across operational tasks. Additionally, a tighter lid on spending with suppliers and vendors, combined with real estate optimization, will drive more cost savings. One caveat, however, is that most of the impact from these actions won't filter through until 2024.</li></ul><p>Beyond the enhanced focus on expenses, there are a couple other key positives to note. </p><ul><li>For instance, YouTube Shorts, which is GOOG's answer to TikTok's short-format video platform, is experiencing strong growth. Specifically, Shorts is now averaging 50 bln daily views compared to 30 bln at the end of Q3. Importantly, the monetization of Shorts is progressing with GOOG introducing revenue sharing this week.</li><li>Another bright spot was the subscription business, which helped drive a 7.7% revenue increase for GOOG's \"Other\" segment. In particular, YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV generated substantial subscriber growth, helping to offset continued weakness in Play", "doc_id": "1554c484-9897-4a10-b915-632ec8c210b4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "02fee32e9e6c4cb368bf12e131a541ec4d714c5a6d9f2eaf24e90cab68d17449", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3843, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "880d77ed-6ea9-4e21-8122-0e4c951d2896", "3": "7692a37a-266c-40cb-a3db-ab3c1cda5c93"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7692a37a-266c-40cb-a3db-ab3c1cda5c93": {"__data__": {"text": "YouTube TV generated substantial subscriber growth, helping to offset continued weakness in Play revenue.</li><li>Lastly, GOOG spent a significant portion of last night's earnings call discussing its opportunities in AI, which Mr. Pichai described as \"the most profound technology its working on today.\" Within the advertising business, GOOG intends to use AI to deliver improved search experiences and better measurement tools, driving higher ROI for advertisers. Outside of advertising, GOOG disclosed that it will make its LaMDA language available to the public soon, enabling people to interact directly with it as a companion to search.</li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that it was another disappointing quarter for GOOG, but the EPS miss isn't overly surprising given that GOOG was late to the cost-cutting party. We believe that most investors already looked past this earnings report and are weighing whether 2023 will hold better results. By prioritizing improvements to its cost base and investing in its most promising opportunities, such as AI, YouTube Shorts, and Subscriptions, a meaningful turnaround could indeed transpire this year.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "7692a37a-266c-40cb-a3db-ab3c1cda5c93", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1533339a0a8696ba6d2cef0b433418ab70671c0bfa1f34e8042658387e7bee69", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3747, "end": 4953, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "880d77ed-6ea9-4e21-8122-0e4c951d2896", "2": "1554c484-9897-4a10-b915-632ec8c210b4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "67d3d540-1a67-422f-80f9-d5aa59067aca": {"__data__": {"text": "HSBC Securities downgraded Meta Platforms (META) to Reduce rating with price target $110&#10;Previous rating: Hold&#10;Issuance Date: 2023-02-03&#10;&#10;Copyright 2023 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "67d3d540-1a67-422f-80f9-d5aa59067aca", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "48cc688b78eac64704ecada64933fef53025a7ae7472550f8148cbf95dd573bd", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 187, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "434dacac-93b9-402d-b960-30ce1578e0e5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "89ce5eb3-2d0c-4d5c-b50f-e006e9644291": {"__data__": {"text": "DZ Bank upgraded Meta Platforms (META) to Hold rating with price target $180&#10;Previous rating: Sell&#10;Issuance Date: 2023-02-03&#10;&#10;Copyright 2023 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "89ce5eb3-2d0c-4d5c-b50f-e006e9644291", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6dd9f602a74c7cd4dc620a06888cf83a2d7a9bdbf5f356f01ce3e95e33803c64", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 175, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "0e77970e-4fda-4c48-9bdd-5d4801513a17"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "29254fab-5e10-4d37-ade7-8cc91f0843ef": {"__data__": {"text": "DZ Bank downgraded NVIDIA (NVDA) to Sell rating with price target $195&#10;Previous rating: Buy&#10;Issuance Date: 2023-02-16&#10;&#10;Copyright 2023 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "29254fab-5e10-4d37-ade7-8cc91f0843ef", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "25e7ad2b3a2db67efd69115e47b9f71144829c81bfe7571d0683323b6a4d6a30", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 168, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "f6f9585c-8d4e-4393-8949-ad5199a5ea7a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8068f392-31af-4ab8-99cf-2c8a8b4ffe98": {"__data__": {"text": "BMO Capital Markets reiterated NVIDIA (NVDA) coverage with Outperform rating and price target $240&#10;Previous price target: $210&#10;Issuance Date: 2023-02-21&#10;&#10;Copyright 2023 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "8068f392-31af-4ab8-99cf-2c8a8b4ffe98", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c5e469aca7620da045e275fcce32ceb86d99c1142c85365580fb2358f8b2e481", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 203, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "638b80b5-a014-4fd2-89ab-b2b38deed5e1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c538b5ad-e67d-4a65-b062-9fd68d637a65": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p>High inventory levels across the consumer electronics space, a slowdown in enterprise IT spending, and macroeconomic uncertainties have plagued the semiconductor industry, but <strong>NVIDIA's</strong> (<strong>NVDA</strong>) beat-and-raise Q4 earnings report is brightening the gloomy sentiment today.</p><ul><li>Last quarter, NVDA predicted that its PC-centric gaming segment (~30% of Q4 revenue) would see a rebound in Q4 as channel inventory levels continue to correct.

The upgrade follows a recent upgrade from Goldman Sachs in late February to \"Buy\" from \"Neutral.\" It also comes after considerable price appreciation. Shares of NVDA have surged by 80% on the year and over 130% since October lows. Still, the stock trades roughly 25% below all-time highs in late 2021. </p><p><strong>Briefing.com notes</strong> that with NVDA leaning on AI trends heavily, which have gained considerable steam since the explosive popularity of ChatGPT, more upgrades could be coming. </p><ul><li> NVDA recently discussed its role in powering AI during a Morgan Stanley technology conference earlier this month. During its presentation, management outlined why AI remains a critical computing component. NVDA also repeated that AI is at an inflection point, stemming from generative AI, e.g., ChatGPT, becoming more mainstream. ChatGPT changes how consumers and enterprises think about AI and how they can benefit from it, whether monetarily or through efficiency gains. </li><li>Customers of all sizes are emphasizing AI. For example, CEOs of large enterprises are focused on where they can utilize AI to their advantage, whether it is a more intuitive chatbot or a simulation of factories. Additionally, startups realize AI's potential through language models like GPT, buoying demand for NVDA's GPUs aimed at training AI models, which sometimes require hundreds of chips. </li><li> This inflection point is what is spurring so much exuberance around NVDA. Many companies are purely in the discussion phase, not yet having started building out their AI infrastructure, or they have grabbed onto an existing model but need more optimization. This future demand potential could be massive, and NVDA is going all-in on capturing the opportunities. </li></ul><p>As exciting as generative AI has proven to be, the road ahead may be bumpy. Complex, unpredictable environments, which require creativity and other human-based qualities, may not be easily tackled by AI, which is bound to its programming. Also, given that AI is only in its early stages, it is not a given that NVDA's chips will win the day; <strong>Advanced Micro (AMD)</strong> and<strong> Intel (INTC)</strong> are both competing to win the AI race.</p><p>  Nevertheless, NVDA's current positioning gives it a competitive edge to be the market leader in AI. Also, even if AI never evolves to solve complex situations, its total addressable market is expansive, from driverless vehicles to factory automation and answering search queries. Still, given its recent substantial appreciation, we urge caution buying NVDA at current levels and think it would be better to wait for a pullback, possibly around its 50-day moving average (209.06).</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "74596926-dec0-4d70-9a67-5a593f143536", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6016ebe57a741f574d24f15785081e7d8c28b623c2ba6e5003341bd1db631185", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2965, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "b2934e94-2ad4-425e-aec0-c5fc9971d0c9"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "efe4ee15-bc57-4215-b8dd-b519eb4488bb": {"__data__": {"text": "Morgan Stanley upgraded NVIDIA (NVDA) to Overweight rating with price target $304&#10;Previous rating: Equal-Weight&#10;Previous price target: $255&#10;Issuance Date: 2023-03-17&#10;&#10;Copyright 2023 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "efe4ee15-bc57-4215-b8dd-b519eb4488bb", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1aaa09d8f70b253b9dbe3137652a8c336525b2361b1114384262cfd40c521438", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 220, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "7320613e-73b6-4118-be1a-182a345ba6fd"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b40acd21-3aa0-4064-8667-c9dff12f6315": {"__data__": {"text": "Edward Jones upgraded Meta Platforms (META) to Buy&#10;Previous rating: Hold&#10;Issuance Date: 2023-03-20&#10;&#10;Copyright 2023 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "b40acd21-3aa0-4064-8667-c9dff12f6315", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ad0d7787e07f7126817c765b33594d81d27e24a22967f03d6540fd052e78cd1c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 149, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "e4f99633-e6bf-4f9e-bda4-f7f1cf762d35"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f4e17b5-c0ed-4001-b2d0-4799c216a151": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p><strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>META</strong>) is gaining some friends in the analyst community this week.

Today, Morgan Stanley followed suit, upgrading the stock to Overweight from Equal-Weight while raising its price target to $250, representing a 23% increase versus the current price.</p><ul><li>Just four months ago, sentiment from investors and analysts alike was about as bearish as it has ever been for META. Following the company's disappointing 3Q22 earnings report in which it missed EPS expectations and guided for a 15% yr/yr increase in expenses for FY23, the stock caught several downgrades. One of those downgrades was at Morgan Stanley, which lowered its rating to Equal-Weight from Overweight.</li><li>In the aftermath of that earnings report in late October and the downgrades that accompanied it, shares of META sank to their lowest level since early 2016.

As a result, the company's FY23 total expense guidance has been reduced from the original forecast of $96-$101 bln to $86-$92 bln with Mr. Zuckerberg now calling this a \"year of efficiency\" for META.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The U-turn on spending is only part of the equation.</p><ul><li>META's focus on creating new AI-based tools to help mitigate the impact from <strong>Apple's</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) iOS privacy changes should boost demand from advertisers as ROI improves on META's platform.</li><li>Additionally, the scrutiny that has been placed on TikTok from politicians, regulators, and the media may be taking a toll on the short-format video app. Last Friday, the U.S. Justice Department announced that it will launch an investigation into the surveillance of Americans by TikTok. A growing number of members of Congress are also backing legislation that would allow the President to ban foreign technology products like TikTok due to national security concerns.</li><li>Whether the investigation or proposed legislation ultimately leads to a ban of TikTok remains to be seen, but with the screws being turned tighter, it stands to reason that some advertisers may look elsewhere.

Major customers include Apple, AMD, Broadcom, Intel, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm. </li><li>Revenue for March fell 15.4% yr/yr to NT$145.41 bln and was down 10.9% from February. For all of Q1, revenue rose 3.6% yr/yr to NT$508.63 bln. The monthly sequential decline tells us that the quarter ended on a weak note, which is a bit troubling and not a great sign for TSM's customers as we head into earnings season. </li><li>In fairness, TSM did warn on its Q4 call in January that it was observing softness entering 2023 in consumer end market demand. Data center-related verticals were softening as well. TSM explained that customers were likely focusing on working down existing inventory before buying new product. As such, TSM predicted that semiconductor supply chain inventory would be reduced sharply through 1H23 to rebalance to a healthier level. </li><li> TSM also said that it expected revenue to decline mid to high-single-digits yr/yr in 1H23 in US dollars. But there were some glimmers of hope as well as TSM said it was starting to see initial signs of demand stabilization. It also forecasted the semiconductor cycle to bottom sometime in 1H23 and to see a healthy recovery in 2H23. We just wonder if this Q1 guidance may cause investors to fear that TSM will turn more cautious on that outlook during its Q1 call on April 20. </li></ul><p>Overall, the guidance was a bit of a letdown, although not entirely surprising given TSM's prior cautious comments. Investors need to remember that TSM is coming off a big year in 2022 with revenue jumping 33.5% in US dollars, fueled by a surge in HPC revenue (+59%) as well as strong growth in smartphones (+28%) and IoT (+47%). As such, some pullback should be expected.

That event sparked worry amongst investors that GOOG was losing its dominant positioning within the online search industry to MSFT. </li><li>Although shares recovered over the next couple of months, today's news illustrates that the wind may have already shifted. Many competitors are popping up within the AI space, jeopardizing GOOG's decades-long dominance among online search engines. However, the real blow would occur if AAPL decided not to renew its contract. </li></ul><p>Despite today's report sparking some fear regarding GOOG's competitive positioning, we do not see GOOG giving up much market share even if Samsung makes Bing its default search engine. Before 2009, when GOOG launched its Android OS, which is used on Samsung's mobile devices, its search engine market share hovered around 60%, crushing Bing's estimated ~9%. Additionally, the Bard setback notwithstanding, GOOG is emphasizing AI development, making it the underlying driver behind its top long-term priorities: Search, ads, YouTube, Cloud, and Pixel.</p><p>  Therefore, although MSFT's AI developments may be beating GOOG to the punch, its current focus and history suggest that it is not too far behind and could quickly surpass MSFT. Since shares are still trading close to YTD highs, the market is also not overly concerned.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "fb8d3ec4-4411-42c5-9316-1c64fe6c8e21", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "714f0bbd1a41647a986165fcaa6ba0c2067951f8ecf562fca1b009680915269a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2883, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "917f54b3-630b-4059-bc22-8631ecfeffd4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7b9a64f-7e4c-4747-bb66-a0342115ae3b": {"__data__": {"text": "New Street downgraded Meta Platforms (META) to Neutral rating with price target $220&#10;Previous rating: Buy&#10;Issuance Date: 2023-04-17&#10;&#10;Copyright 2023 Briefing.com, Inc.", "doc_id": "d7b9a64f-7e4c-4747-bb66-a0342115ae3b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b9be1047f6977327a8f40e756dcf6ccae199ba8e347eef413dd384b6845f4037", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 182, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "576837f4-e807-4dd6-af5c-345767a474ac"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6452b81-21d5-4134-b3e5-84fe2a201a75": {"__data__": {"text": "<html><body><p><strong>Taiwan Semi (TSM)</strong> is trading relatively flat today following an upgrade at Susquehanna to \"Positive\" from \"Neutral.\" After numerous red days over the past few weeks, shares of TSM flirted with previous support around the $86 mark. Although today's move is minor, it could signal a higher low. </p><p> <strong>Briefing.com notes</strong> that today's positive analyst rating comes amid several unpleasant developments from TSM and the semiconductor space. Last week, TSM issued disappointing Q1 guidance, noting revenue fell by 15.4% yr/yr, below consensus. The next day, Warren Buffett <strong>(BRK.B)</strong> disclosed that he sold nearly all of his TSM stake earlier this year, citing geopolitical tensions. Today, reports indicate that TSM may lower its FY23 capital expenditures to $28-32 bln, significantly below its initial forecast of $32-36 bln. </p><ul><li>After TSM's underwhelming Q1 forecast, we cautioned that tech firms utilizing TSM to manufacture its chips, which include market movers like <strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong> and <strong>Qualcomm (QCOM)</strong>, may run into some troubles ahead of earnings season. TSM's Smartphone revenue already reversed its positive momentum in Q4 after experiencing sequential growth in the previous two quarters. <ul><li> Rival <strong>Samsung's (SSNLF)</strong> weak guidance last week increases the likeliness of turbulence within the semiconductor industry, at least for the first part of FY23. </li></ul></li><li>Coinciding with softening demand dynamics are geopolitical concerns. TSM's two most prominent regions in terms of revenue and physical presence are China and the U.S. There are numerous reports regarding China/Taiwan relations and how tensions may be heating up. This uncertainty can bring higher volatility surrounding shares of TSM, especially on any nerve-racking headlines. </li><li> TSM's CapEx is spent in anticipation of future growth. However, growth has been decelerating over the past few quarters, illustrated by CapEx in FY22 coming in at just over $36 bln, well below its forecast six months prior of approximately $40 bln. The additional cut signals further weakness and makes management's comments last quarter that demand may have started stabilizing less concrete. <ul><li> The news also adversely impacts semiconductor equipment firms like <strong>Lam Research (LRCX)</strong>, <strong>ASML (ASML)</strong>, and <strong>KLA Corp (KLAC)</strong>, all of which are down meaningfully today. </li></ul></li></ul><p> Although recent developments signal a tough road ahead, conditions may not be as gloomy as they appear. TSM, as well as many of its peers like <strong>Micron (MU)</strong>, have discussed the possibility of a recovery toward the second half of the year, meaning that a bottom could occur within the next couple of quarters. Meanwhile, although geopolitical risks are real, TSM has been bolstering its U.S. presence, building a second chip plant in Arizona. Also, there would be no benefit to destroying TSM's factories if a worst-case scenario occurred, limiting some financial risk to TSM. </p><p> Bottom line, near-term macroeconomic conditions could bring turbulence for TSM. However, the move toward a fabless business model across the tech industry keeps TSM's long-term positioning resilient. Finally, TSM reports Q1 earnings on April 20.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "a6452b81-21d5-4134-b3e5-84fe2a201a75", "embedding": null, "doc_hash":

surprise turn to profitability in the Cloud segment enabled Google parent<strong> Alphabet </strong>(<strong>GOOG</strong>) to top 1Q23 EPS estimates, ending a streak of four consecutive earnings misses. GOOG, which helped kick off this earnings season for the tech sector, described its core Search business as \"resilient\" in Q1, while the Cloud segment once again delivered the strongest revenue growth at +28%.</p><ul><li>The upside results aren't the only piece of good news that the company had to share. GOOG also announced a huge $70 bln stock buyback authorization, providing the company with another EPS lever to pull while it continues to work through a cost restructuring program.</li><li>On that note, GOOG's cost-cutting initiatives, including the 12,000 layoffs it announced in January, did have an impact in Q1. This is reflected in its operating margin improving by six percentage points on a sequential basis to 30%.</li></ul><p>However, other aspects of GOOG's earnings report were less impressive.</p><ul><li>Most notably, YouTube ad revenue was down again, decreasing by nearly 3% to $6.69 bln. While that number did top analysts' muted expectations, and is better than last quarter's 8% drop, the general takeaway is that ad demand on the video platform remains soft. </li><li>In addition to the pullback in ad spending, competition from TikTok has cut into YouTube's market share. On the positive side, GOOG noted last night that YouTube Shorts -- its answer to TikTok's short format videos -- experienced an 80% surge in the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts.</li></ul><p>GOOG's financial results weren't necessarily the main event yesterday, though. Taking center stage was the company's updates on its AI/chatbot development, which GOOG's future growth largely hinges on.</p><ul><li>The primary message from the earnings call was that AI is now GOOG's primary focus and that the technology will be deployed across all of its products areas, including the advertising business.</li><li>Generative AI will not only create a top-line catalyst as its integrated into ads, phones, and the cloud, but it will also facilitate better cost efficiencies across the company by redistributing workloads within data centers.</li><li>GOOG was clearly bullish on its AI prospects.

In fact, this was MSFT's largest EPS beat in the past eight quarters and it guided Q4 (Jun) revs in-line. In our preview, we noted our caution heading into this report and we think many investors shared our concerns. However, MSFT came through with impressive results. </p><ul><li> <strong>Let's start with Azure</strong>, which grew +27%, but +31% constant currency (CC), generally in-line with the low-30s CC prior guidance and we would argue better than feared given all the macro headwinds. Azure growth continues to slow from +38% CC in DecQ, +42% CC in SepQ and +46% CC in JunQ. MSFT then guided to +26-27% CC in JunQ but we think that guidance was better than feared. </li><li> MSFT saying that Azure took market share was encouraging to hear. Also, it said Unilever went all-in on Azure in MarQ in one of the largest ever cloud migrations in the consumer goods industry. However, it was not all good news as MSFT noted that Azure customers continued to exercise some caution as optimization and new workload trends from the prior quarter continued as expected. </li><li>Moving beyond Azure, <strong>Teams usage</strong> is at an all-time high and surpassed 300 mln monthly active users this quarter. LinkedIn saw record engagement. Gaming set MarQ records for monthly active users and monthly active devices.</li><li> <strong>Commercial revenue </strong>was up 19% CC. MSFT saw better-than-expected renewal strength, including across Microsoft 365, which also benefited Windows Commercial. PC demand was a bit better than expected, particularly in the Commercial segment, which benefited Windows OEM and Surface, even as channel inventory levels remain elevated. Advertising spend landed in line with expectations. MSFT has seen share gains in Azure, Dynamics, Teams, Security, Edge, and Bing. </li><li>There was more news besides earnings today. Microsoft is in the process of acquiring <strong>Activision Blizzard (ATVI)</strong>, but that transaction hit a snag today as the UK CMA said it will block the deal because the combination would weaken competitiveness in the cloud gaming market. ATVI said it will appeal, but CNBC's David Faber says the likelihood of success is \"very slim.\" We think this could jeopardize the deal or potentially change it substantially if divestitures are required. </li></ul><p>Overall, this was an impressive report for Microsoft and shows that our concerns were perhaps overblown. We also think that this report, coupled with a strong <strong>Alphabet (GOOG) </strong>report, could reset some of the negativity we have seen in recent weeks around the mega cap tech space.

<strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>META</strong>) returned to positive top-line growth in 1Q23 while it slashed costs, leading to a strong earnings report that's catapulting shares to their highest levels since early February of 2022. The stock's surge, which is also bolstering the broader stock market's gains, is also a function of META's pleasing outlook for Q2.</p><ul><li>Over the past six quarters, META either issued inline or downside revenue guidance for the quarter ahead, but META ended that losing streak last night with its upside 2Q23 revenue guidance.</li><li>Importantly, that revenue forecast of $29.5-$32.0 bln suggests that growth could accelerate to as high as 10% following this quarter's 2.6% increase, indicating that advertising demand is thawing, and that META has slowed or halted TikTok's momentum.</li><li>When <strong>Google</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) posted better-than-expected Q1 results on Tuesday night that included flat advertising revenue after back-to-back yr/yr declines, a significant piece of evidence pointing to a stabilization of demand was provided. META's results offered some confirmation of that assertion as its ad impressions jumped by 26% in Q1.</li></ul><p>It's not only the healthier digital advertising environment that's fueling META's return to growth.</p><ul><li>During the earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg called out the company's emerging AI capabilities as a key factor behind the rebound. Specifically, META is using AI to identify the best short-form videos to distribute in its Reels platform, which is improving monetization. </li><li>He added that Reels monetization efficiency is up by more than 30% on Instagram and up over 40% on Facebook on a sequential basis. Furthermore, AI has powered a 24% increase in time spend on Instagram.</li></ul><p>These are encouraging data points that really ease the competitive and sinking ad demand concerns, but there is a caveat: namely, META is lapping easier yr/yr comparisons. In the year-earlier period, revenue was up by only 6.5%, and it gets even easier over the rest of the year as META laps a 0.9% decrease in Q2, followed by declines of 4.5% in Q3 and Q4.&nbsp;<br><br>Still, it's clear that business is improving for META in this \"year of efficiency.\" </p><ul><li>That moniker, which was coined by Mr. Zuckerberg, has essentially equated to mass layoffs across the company.&nbsp;Following a round of 11,000 layoffs that were announced last year, META disclosed that it was planning to layoff 10,000 more employees in March.</li><li>As of March 31, 2023, META had completed most of the 2022 layoffs, but there are more cuts on the horizon. There is one more wave of layoffs coming, which should be completed in April and May. </li><li>Perhaps as important as the upside revenue guidance, META also once again lowered its FY23 expense guidance, forecasting $86-$90 bln in expenses vs. its prior guidance of $86-$92 bln. For some perspective on META's cost-cutting efforts, the company originally planned on expenses of $94-$100 bln when it issued 3Q22 results last October.</li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that META delivered exactly what investors wanted to see. It checked off all the boxes: stabilizing/improving digital ad space; significant progress in its AI development, another reduction in expense guidance, and improving monetization of Reels.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "e9e5cc2c-933a-49e0-9f02-a2027b1a17d6", "embedding": null, "doc_hash":

+5%) </strong>is trading nicely higher after reporting Q2 (Mar) results last night. The headline numbers of a nice EPS beat and upside revenue were quite good, especially in light of macro and FX headwinds. After production headaches due to China COVID shutdowns in DecQ, Apple says that supply was not a problem in MarQ. Apple also announced a $90 bln share repurchase program and hiked the dividend by 4%. </p><ul><li><strong>iPhone was the star of the show</strong> with revenue coming in much better than expected. Revenue rose 1.5% yr/yr to $51.33 bln, a record iPhone result for MarQ. Apple says iPhone 14 continues to delight users with its long-lasting battery and advanced camera. Apple said that production issues in DecQ may have pushed some sales into MarQ. iPhone outperformance helped to offset weakness in other areas. </li><li> <strong>Probably the biggest disappointment was Mac sales</strong>, which fell 31% yr/yr to $7.17 bln, which was below street estimates. In fairness, Mac was lapping a very difficult compare last year which included the incredibly successful rollout of its M1 chips throughout its Mac lineup. However, Apple also conceded that Mac faced some macroeconomic and FX headwinds. </li><li><strong>iPad revenue fell 13%</strong> yr/yr at $6.67 bln, which was in-line with street ests, Similar to Mac, iPad revenue was hurt by macro and FX challenges as well as lapping the M1-powered iPad Air last year. </li><li> <strong>Wearables revenue was flat</strong> yr/yr at $8.76 bln, which was slight upside. Wearables was up 5% to $20.9 bln, which was a bit light but not bad. </li><li> <strong>Emerging Markets was another important topic</strong> with India being described as an \"incredibly exciting market\" and a major focus for Apple. It just launched its first two Apple stores there, one in Mumbai and one in Delhi. CEO Tim Cook visited and saw a lot of excitement firsthand. There are a lot of people coming into the middle-class, and Apple feels that India is at a tipping point. Apple also had a stellar quarter in other emerging markets, with records set in several countries. </li></ul><p><strong>Overall, it was a solid quarter but pretty much as expected. </strong>Strong iPhone revenue helped to offset some weakness in Macs an iPads. The sizeable buyback authorization and dividend hike were a nice bonus. <strong>All eyes now turn to WWDC</strong>, Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference in early June. Excitement is building for what is expected to be the launch of Apple's AR/VR headset, which would be a new product category for Apple. The first headsets are expected to be pretty pricey with cheaper versions likely in the next couple of years. </p><p>Apple shares have been on a nice uptrend, up nearly 40% from their January lows and the stock is flirting a new 52-week high today. Suppliers to keep on note include: <strong>SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM</strong>, and <strong>QCOM</strong>, among others (<strong>SMH</strong>); <strong>SSNLF</strong>, <strong>LPL </strong>(for displays) and <strong>LITE </strong>(for FaceID).</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id": "0a0bf8e3-0b1f-4097-a188-37546373604f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash":

2022, the hype surrounding generative AI has exploded, but there's nothing artificial about how the emergence of this technology is igniting a powerful growth catalyst for chip maker <strong>NVIDIA</strong> (<strong>NVDA</strong>). <br><br>Last night, NVDA delivered an unforgettable Q1 earnings report in which it not only easily surpassed quarterly EPS and revenue estimates, but it also issued Q2 revenue guidance that made a mockery of analysts' estimates. In fact, the magnitude of upside was so great that we initially believed there may have been an error in regard to the consensus estimate figure. However, looking back at NVDA's Q1 guidance of $6.37-$6.63 bln, we found that the company itself badly underestimated the level of demand for its GPUs.</p><ul><li>NVDA's Q2 revenue guidance of $11.0 bln, plus or minus 2%,  crushed estimates by about $4.0 bln, launching the stock to new all-time highs and taking other AI-focused semiconductor stocks for a ride higher, too. </li><li>For instance, competitor <strong>Advanced Micro Devices</strong> (<strong>AMD</strong>) is making an impressive move higher, as is <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing</strong> (<strong>TSM</strong>), which makes NVDA's chips.</li></ul><p>Simply stated, NVDA's spectacular earnings report put it at the center of the AI universe. </p><ul><li>The company's Data Center segment in particular is perfectly positioned to capitalize on what CEO Jensen Huang has called a \"ten-year transition\" to retool data centers in order to support&nbsp;accelerated computing and generative AI.</li><li>This transition will touch upon almost any industry one can think of. As Mr. Huang stated in the earnings press release, companies are \"racing to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process.\" </li><li>Critically, NVDA doesn't seem to be contending with any serious supply chain issues or materials shortages, stating that it's significantly increasing supply to meet the surge in demand.</li></ul><p>NVDA is only in the first inning of this growth cycle. </p><ul><li>Revenue actually decreased by about 13% in Q1, but the company's Q2 guidance calls for a huge upswing in growth to 64% at the midpoint.

The company's rising momentum in AI through its expanding lineup of GPUs fueled last week's incredible earnings report that featured a Q2 outlook that crushed expectations, sending shares skyrocketing higher.&nbsp;<br><br>Including today's gains, NVDA has soared by 178% on a year-to-year basis, blowing away rival chip makers like <strong>Advanced Micro Devices</strong> (<strong>AMD</strong>) and <strong>Intel </strong>(<strong>INTC</strong>), which are up by 95% and 10%, respectively.</p><ul><li>What NVDA's earnings report showed was that the company is separating itself from the pack in the race to develop chips that not only power generative AI applications such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, but also underpin many other AI-related technologies. <ul><li>CEO Jensen Huang&nbsp;stated in the Q1 earnings press release that companies are \"racing to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process.\" </li><li>More specifically, Mr. Huang highlighted robotics, gaming, advertising, and networking as a few areas where NVDA's AI-based chips will be in high demand.</li></ul></li></ul><p>To capitalize on the AI boom, NVDA is launching a set of new products that could significantly extend its lead over the competition.</p><ul><li>The headliner is a new system called \"DGX GH200\", an AI supercomputer that's powered by 256 of NVDA's GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips. For some context, this new supercomputer has almost 500x the memory of NVDA's previous DGX A100 system. <ul><li>According to the company, this new large-memory AI supercomputer will \"enable the development of giant, next-generation models for generative AI language applications, recommender systems and data analytics workloads.\"</li><li><strong>Google</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>), <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<strong>MSFT</strong>), and <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>META</strong>) will be the first companies to use the DGX GH200 platform as they build out their generative AI capabilities.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In addition to the new product launches, NVDA also announced two key collaborations that should move the needle on the top-line. </p><ul><li><strong>Softbank</strong> (<strong>SFTBY</strong>), the Japan-based telecom giant, is planning to develop a platform for generative AI and 5G/6G applications that are powered by NVDA's GH200 Grace Hopper superchip. More specifically, SFTBY intends to deploy distributed AI data centers across Japan that can host generative AI and wireless applications, helping to reduce costs and improve energy efficiency.</li><li>NVDA also announced an agreement with <strong>WPP</strong> (<strong>WPP</strong>), one of the world's largest advertising and marketing agencies. WPP is creating a content engine based on NVIDIA Omniverse --&nbsp;a platform for connecting 3D tools and developing digitalization applications -- that will enable its clients to create ads more quickly and in a very personalized way. <ul><li>The NVIDA Omniverse will link with other content creation tools, such as Getty Images and <strong>Adobe</strong> (<strong>ADBE</strong>), facilitating a user friendly and efficient platform for ad creation.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that this weekend's series of announcements from NVDA further solidifies the notion that the company is at the forefront of this AI evolution and that it's only in the early innings of this powerful trend.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>", "doc_id":
